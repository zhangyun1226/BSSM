# BSSM
This code is used in Table VI of the paper ‘A Bionic Spiking Sequence Memory Model with Minicolumns, Dendrites and Oscillation’. These codes are used for sequence memory, the specific functions are shown as follows:
1. BSSM-main is the code for the proposed BSSM, which simulates the process of brain memory encoding, storing, and retrieval. It is a minicolumn-based model and comprehensively considers the mechanisms involved in human memory, such as neural minicolumns, pyramidal neurons, interneurons, and oscillation.
2. BSTM is the code for our previous work published in 2022 TNNLS, cited as 'Zhang Y, Chen Y, Zhang J, et al. Minicolumn-Based Episodic Memory Model With Spiking Neurons, Dendrites and Delays[J]. IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems, 2022 (99): 1-15'. It is a minicolumn-based sequence memory model.
3. HTM0406-1 is the code for the HTM, which is a minicolumn-based sequence memory model.
4. LSNN&SNN+LIF is the code for the model LSNN and SNN+LIF, which are SNN-based sequence memory models.
5. Lstm2023 is the code for the LSTM, which is the traditional deep sequence memory model.
