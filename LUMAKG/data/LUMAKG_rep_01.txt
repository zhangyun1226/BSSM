sentence 271:who had lost her husband soon after the king's death 
sentence 272:both continued to mourn the loss of their dear prince 
sentence 273:as prince alphege's governess and her daughter were alone together 
sentence 274:but i can not get it out of my heart 
sentence 275:lost no time in rising and hurrying to the garden at to in and 
sentence 276:where she found all as the good queen had described 
sentence 277:her suspicions were confirmed by the fairy of the mountain they the the

sentence 281:its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered 
sentence 282:could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions 
sentence 283:still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble 
sentence 284:then she sent her away without doing her any harm 
sentence 285:one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe 
sentence 286:but he had no idea where he was to go 
sentence 287:immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her round her her round 
sentence 288:one might have thought that all would now be well 
sentence 289:by a lady exactly like the one she had quitted 
sentence 290:here again she received a present with the same injunctions

sentence 292:in which he had been held ever since his disappearance 
sentence 293:on opening the crystal scentbottle a little syren flew out the flew 
sentence 294:but before she had got far he was wide awake 
sentence 295:that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased 
sentence 296:nor the mutual affection of king rainbow and his queen 
sentence 297:so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head 
sentence 298:saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone 
sentence 299:let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss 
sentence 300:the flaming torch only lit up dirty grey stone walls 
sentence 301:everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper 
sentence 302:the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl 
sentence 303:but as he was a little suspicious of his brothers 
sentence 304:it fell to the bottom broken into a hundred pieces 
sentence 305:said the youth sadly and he began to cry bitterly 
sentence 306:i will bring you at once up to the earth 
sentence 307:searching for the nest in which the little children lay the the which 
sentence 308:they trembled with terror when they saw the hideous creature

sentence 310:he burst into a room where they were all assembled 
sentence 311:but the good youth forgave them all they had done 
sentence 312:then he built himself a big castle with golden windows 
sentence 313:he took his bow and arrows and left the hut 
sentence 314:then she also forgot the boy alone in the forest 
sentence 315:when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl 
sentence 316:never let the child put his feet on the ground the on 
sentence 317:when he was too heavy for his nurse to carry 
sentence 318:accompanied always by his father's studgroom and a numerous retinue 
sentence 319:every day he rode through the neighbouring fields and woods 
sentence 320:more from use and wont than for any other reason 
sentence 321:just as the horsemen were about to ford the river 
sentence 322:started up from the grass and ran towards the thicket 
sentence 323:against which the queen had warned them on her deathbed 
sentence 324:at every step he seemed to sink into the clouds 
sentence 325:all the trees of the wood lying felled around him 
sentence 326:morning had hardly dawned when the fairy awoke the prince 
sentence 327:he returned to the castle as quickly as he could 
sentence 328:she was even more amazed than she had been before 
sentence 329:threw it in the direction her mother was coming from 
sentence 330:when the fairy saw this her rage knew no bounds 
sentence 331:she threw a lot of gold nuts into the pond 
sentence 332:for the little creature refused to let itself be caught 
sentence 333:hiding herself behind the rock which had sheltered the fugitives 
sentence 334:she found herself in front of a great stone church 
sentence 335:she tried to plunge her dagger into the monk's heart 
sentence 336:in her desperation she determined to pull down the church 
sentence 337:so as not to be hurt herself by its fall 
sentence 338:but the youth did not lose his presence of mind 
sentence 339:circled round the prince's head in the most confiding manner 
sentence 340:the next night there was not only wood and fire 
sentence 341:we have seen no one yet it is too soon

sentence 346:the thought of her remained with him night and day 
sentence 347:for he knew not how long his journey would take 
sentence 348:but grew less and less the farther he went south 
sentence 349:then he knew that he was in the right road 
sentence 350:so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island 
sentence 351:they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat 
sentence 352:you shall take again your body which you left behind 
sentence 353:thought to herself why shouldn't i bathe in that cool

sentence 355:the wicked witch had pushed her into the deep water 
sentence 356:but the young ones did not listen to their mother 
sentence 357:ground her teeth with anger but she hid her feelings 
sentence 358:showed them a soft cushion on which they might sleep 
sentence 359:in the meantime the two little ducklings had fallen asleep 
sentence 360:muttered the witch i think ill go in and see 
sentence 361:looking for her little ones she called and she searched 
sentence 362:the king heard the sad complaint of the white duck

sentence 367:as i had not much belief in the magician's warning 
sentence 368:the fruit was plucked and stolen by an invisible hand 
sentence 369:next morning not a single apple remained on the trees 
sentence 370:the prince hastily seized the bird's wings in his hands 
sentence 371:an evil magician has not robbed you of your fruit 
sentence 372:when she was dying she bade me take the fruit

sentence 374:think of her sometimes if you never see her again 
sentence 375:if it sparkles as brightly as ever go straight on

sentence 378:in another six months they had forgotten all about him 
sentence 379:there wouldn't be one bit for each hundred of them 
sentence 380:then he seized the hare and threw it to them 
sentence 381:all his body was covered with prickles like a hedgehog hedgehog hedgehog was engaged 
sentence 382:with this new protector iwanich wandered on through the forest 
sentence 383:at the exit of the wood the lion stood still

sentence 385:although the princess was very unhappy at leaving her husband 
sentence 386:but on the third he could stand it no longer 
sentence 387:on every one of which a man's skull was stuck

sentence 398:this time corva received him in the most friendly manner 
sentence 399:the witch pretended to be much astonished at his request 
sentence 400:said that he deserved something much better than the foal 
sentence 401:or you will fall into the power of his friends 
sentence 402:when the magician found himself face to face with iwanich 
sentence 403:though all his life long he had toiled and moiled 
sentence 404:he only left his widow and son two hundred florins 
sentence 405:a great noise of angry voices and barking of dogs 
sentence 406:i had no money over to buy anything else with 
sentence 407:for the ring which he wears on his little finger 
sentence 408:in the middle of the field stood a magnificent castle
