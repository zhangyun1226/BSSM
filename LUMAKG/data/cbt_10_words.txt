no one will trouble to take it away from there
as soon as it was evening she went home again
as this child has a white ring round its neck
they are such curious names they make me very thoughtful
when it is all gone one can be at rest
the mouse asked at once after the third child's name
she received the king as if she were expecting him
the next day the king came to visit his children
she ran all through the night and the next day
but when the sun had set she heard a noise
they stood on the floor and blew at one another
with every spring it covered half a mile of ground
was to remain for several years in the same place
after some years he met with a famous eastern magician
which made him able to understand the language of birds
who has come so far without finding what he seeks
as she does every month when the moon is full
in order that she may never grow old nor wrinkled
when they went back to their old perch to sleep
listened attentively to what they were saying to each other
the full moon was already shining down upon the forest
at your coming i did not know what to do
because i thought my silent watching could not offend you
we might be married and might live together like princes
if i do not decide immediately on this important matter
one day the maiden took him into a secret chamber
i will give you this ring as a marriage gift
but in order that our love may last for ever
to conceal his feelings and to make no direct answer
but even with my halfknowledge i can work great wonders
then i can with its help produce whatever i wish
after a while she put it back into the box
it glittered as she held it like the clearest sunbeam
she took the knife and tried to strike the youth
put the ring upon the thumb of your left hand
for now you see i have told you the truth
else he might strike you dead with his long tail
the youth now began to consider how he should act
found that in this way he could easily move forwards
man and horse would have been swallowed up by them
when he at length lost power to move his tail
a pestilence broke out which destroyed many hundreds of people
do you expect to live happily as the king's soninlaw
now the tables are turned you are in my power
you have doubly wronged me first you scorned my love
the magician soon found out what he wished to know
nor has it ever again been seen by mortal eyes
would you not rather have stayed with the pretty witchmaiden
but they had not the least thing on the looms
they also demanded the finest silk and the best gold
worked at the empty looms till late into the night
so he praised the cloth which he did not see
everybody in the town was talking of the magnificent cloth
said both the old statesmen who had already been there
for he would not say that he could see nothing
went from mouth to mouth everyone seemed delighted over them
they pretended they were taking the cloth from the loom
for then he would have been unfit for his office
holding up the train which was not there at all
let down thy petticoat that lets thy feet be seen
for she was not quite pleased at the crab's remarks
in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle
where the crab presented the other garment to his bride
no sooner had he said this than he shook himself
but her mother still thought the whole matter very strange
in the evening the princess told this to the crab
the following evening the prince dressed himself for the tournament
for if you do this evil will come of it
he hid himself in the hall behind a great picture
one of them took up a goblet filled with wine
now she desired him to guide her thither at once
but ran forward and threw her arms round her husband
she had been wandering round and round for nine days
if you will promise to do what i ask you
i am a greater prince than you are a princess
what can a young lassie do with an iron stove
but he brought her in two hours to her house
the old king fell on her neck and kissed her
the old king was so frightened that he nearly fainted
as soon as she reached it she began to scrape
made the hole so large that he could get out
he wanted to take her with him to his kingdom
when midnight came she saw afar off a little light
must wander over mountain and valley till she found him
the little toad went and brought out a great chest
she went in and gave herself out as a servant
she cracked one and was going to eat the kernel
saying that it was not a dress for a servingmaid
the servants outside heard how she cried the whole night
asked that she should sleep again by the prince's door
when the bride saw it she wanted to have it
but the prince took care not to drink the sleepingdraught
when they came to the great lake they rowed across
on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in
so they arrived at last at the little old house
which was much larger than that of the princess's father's
so they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth
now if we remain here we shall die of hunger
then he went by another way through the window secretly
the rib of a whale shall be our silver spoon
the next morning when he awoke he remembered the promise
darling daughter we have more right to it than he
she told her how they could get hold of it
i have travelled so far now that i will rest
turn into this beautiful castle money i have in plenty
he laid his head on her lap and fell asleep
but when the hunter had finished his sleep and awoke
at last he got hold of another kind of cabbage
but scarcely had swallowed it when he felt another change
the hunter now lay down and slept off his weariness
so that his own mother would not have known him
he opened his sack and gave her the bad one
ran into the courtyard in the shape of a donkey
i will go to the kitchen and fetch it myself
i am bringing you the delicious food my own self
one beating and three meals and to the youngest one
then the beautiful maiden fell on her knees before him
the fairies declared that diamantino was much the worst indeed
determined to bring up the little princess serpentine among themselves
the one comfort the poor king had was his son
what was his surprise to see reflected in the mirror
it was impossible to get him out of the room
neglected all her duties for the sake of the mirror
when these things happened saphir was about eighteen years old
when he had been left alone for a few minutes
as to his voice i can say nothing about that
in a little while the bird flew into the room
the love the people bore king peridor was so strong
saphir shook it impatiently off but it was no good
i am a friend of the bird you are seeking
pay no heed to anything except what i tell you
at last he arrived at the gate of the castle
already had his hand on the finest horse it contained
who could only find very lame excuses for his conduct
where the frog was awaiting him with a good scolding
so that they once more allowed him to leave quietly
walk straight to the garden and enter through a portico
you must cut the branch on which it is sitting
though he noticed a splendid golden cage hanging close by
holding his breath and walking on tiptoe all the way
but i did not think you had ever seen mine
wished me to be in ignorance as to my family
you know that fairies insist on being obeyed without questioning
to appear to your eyes under so monstrous a form
when one of the fairies appeared in her ivory car
began fondling him as well as a bird can do
in which all the plants of the world flourished together
the same thing happened yearly until many years had passed
now the king of this unhappy country was growing old
go by a secret passage which i will show you
if he catches sight of you he will seize you
my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread
then we will give you a bit of our bread
at these words poor ferko wept more bitterly than before
the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed
so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day
but no one heard him or came to his help
as he thought under the shadow of a big tree
my eyes are in no want of this healing bath
he had not gone far before he met a wolf
so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing
they had managed to obtain places in the king's service
suggest something for him to do no matter how difficult
if he fails in the attempt let him be hung
commanded ferko to set to work on the following day
all round hyacinths and other sweetsmelling flowers bloomed in masses
but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy
wondering how he was to get out of the difficulty
my kind benefactor but why are you looking so sad
together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom
he turned once more to the two brothers and said
all the next day he spent wandering about the fields
i have collected together all the wolves in the kingdom
i will help you to drive all the wolves together
in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him
he drove them all before him on to the hill
for she was shut up in her tower weeping bitterly
then the king raised his voice again and called out
ate them and the whole court up in a moment
the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes
were much beloved by great and small in the land
day and night he spent out in the open fields
when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks
he rose up and followed the direction of the noise
so that you too may come with us under ground
the poor youth fell to and ate and drank lustily
slipping into her room in the middle of the night
that he had forgotten the belt which made him invisible
she saw this dislike only increased as he grew older
he at once jumped at the chance of disobeying her
the king of this island had a daughter named rosalie
did i not see her caught up into the air
the unfortunate girl is pining away in some unknown land
above them was a rampart of orange and lemon trees
the first land he sighted was the island of roses
he went at once to the court of the king
he passed both days and nights in bemoaning his loss
he cried shall i never see my lovely princess again
all the splendour in the world can never console me
he thought of nothing but how best to deliver rosalie
at these words the prince could contain himself no longer
as he was strolling along an alley in the woods
but instead of love i only saw scorn and contempt
he lost no time in setting out to deliver rosalie
travelled so fast that he soon arrived at the forest
that if he could manage to reach the oak tree
but his bad luck followed him even on the sea
mingled with the sweetest songs which had ever charmed him
but the names of the princesses were unknown to him
then without a word passed the cords round their throats
but hardly had he come within reach of the enemy
in order to add to the list of his prisoners
at this sight the prince became more puzzled than ever
no one can speak as long as he is invisible
that i sit daily on the edge of this fountain
it was at this moment that the invisible prince appeared
the sudden desire to get some news of his sister
i know that the princess argentine will never love me
after walking some time they arrived at the golden fountain
in a moment he felt the princess's hand in his
burning up the forests and even the fields of corn
in this garden the youngest princess used often to walk
who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery
they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay
it was difficult to believe that it was the same
for it had all been rebuilt and done up again
raised the bundle on his shoulders and bore it off
two miles from this place are standing seven windmills see
for if i were to put my hat on straight
your head and his must be guaranteed for the winner
put a horse's skull which was lying on the ground
in the room was a table spread with delicious food
then he called all the tailors in the kingdom together
who took the deepest interest in all the queen's concerns
but it was nothing compared to that of the king
he perched on the top of a large orange tree
uttered the most heartbreaking shrieks and cries but her captor
restore to me the liberty you have deprived me of
the king retorted that her opposition filled him with despair
he might well have pleased any other than this princess
vowed that he would search the world for the princess
the fairy went out in hopes of seeing the parrot
but was so dazzled at first by the princess's beauty
the parrot noticed with joy how much he was disliked
i have a most important secret to confide to you
i am here on behalf of the queen your mother
with the object of delivering your highness to prove which
who was now conducting her in safety to her mother
as well as the amiable prince who had rescued her
warned the queen that the wizard king would shortly arrive
deeply offended at the cruel revenge which had been attempted
ordered him to be removed and locked up in prison
he wandered about all day full of despair and misery
one morning he rose up before dawn and went outside
for he could not forget his compact with the nixy
the lord of the land took him into his service
in a short time he married a pretty young wife
which from childhood up he had been taught to avoid
time dragged heavily till the time of the full moon
but they did not recognise each other in the least
many knights had come from afar to try their luck
in spite of having their horses shod with sharp nails
the whole neighbourhood had the appearance of a vast churchyard
nothing was left of either of them except their bones
he fastened them on to his own hands and feet
he could hardly draw breath he was so worn out
but as soon as he threw an apple at it
but as the eagle had lost its feet it died
she therefore sent the prince a large and splendid ruby
who was married to the sovereign of a distant country
who had lost her husband soon after the king's death
both continued to mourn the loss of their dear prince
as prince alphege's governess and her daughter were alone together
but i can not get it out of my heart
lost no time in rising and hurrying to the garden
where she found all as the good queen had described
her suspicions were confirmed by the fairy of the mountain
assured the queen that he would soon punish the conspirators
to find out the truth for himself so one night
she then gave two glass bottles into the princess's charge
its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered
could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions
still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble
then she sent her away without doing her any harm
one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe
but he had no idea where he was to go
immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her
one might have thought that all would now be well
by a lady exactly like the one she had quitted
here again she received a present with the same injunctions
draped with curtains of all the colours of the rainbow
in which he had been held ever since his disappearance
on opening the crystal scentbottle a little syren flew out
but before she had got far he was wide awake
that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased
nor the mutual affection of king rainbow and his queen
so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head
saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone
let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss
the flaming torch only lit up dirty grey stone walls
everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper
the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl
but as he was a little suspicious of his brothers
it fell to the bottom broken into a hundred pieces
said the youth sadly and he began to cry bitterly
i will bring you at once up to the earth
searching for the nest in which the little children lay
they trembled with terror when they saw the hideous creature
then the youth swung his mighty sword in the air
he burst into a room where they were all assembled
but the good youth forgave them all they had done
then he built himself a big castle with golden windows
he took his bow and arrows and left the hut
then she also forgot the boy alone in the forest
when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl
never let the child put his feet on the ground
when he was too heavy for his nurse to carry
accompanied always by his father's studgroom and a numerous retinue
every day he rode through the neighbouring fields and woods
more from use and wont than for any other reason
just as the horsemen were about to ford the river
started up from the grass and ran towards the thicket
against which the queen had warned them on her deathbed
at every step he seemed to sink into the clouds
all the trees of the wood lying felled around him
morning had hardly dawned when the fairy awoke the prince
he returned to the castle as quickly as he could
she was even more amazed than she had been before
threw it in the direction her mother was coming from
when the fairy saw this her rage knew no bounds
she threw a lot of gold nuts into the pond
for the little creature refused to let itself be caught
hiding herself behind the rock which had sheltered the fugitives
she found herself in front of a great stone church
she tried to plunge her dagger into the monk's heart
in her desperation she determined to pull down the church
so as not to be hurt herself by its fall
but the youth did not lose his presence of mind
circled round the prince's head in the most confiding manner
the next night there was not only wood and fire
we have seen no one yet it is too soon
they saw in the snow the steps of two people
the man grieved sore all the days of his life
but she would listen to one only a handsome chief
the heart of her lover had been set upon her
the thought of her remained with him night and day
for he knew not how long his journey would take
but grew less and less the farther he went south
then he knew that he was in the right road
so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island
they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat
you shall take again your body which you left behind
thought to herself why shouldn't i bathe in that cool
she slipped off her robes and stepped into the water
the wicked witch had pushed her into the deep water
but the young ones did not listen to their mother
ground her teeth with anger but she hid her feelings
showed them a soft cushion on which they might sleep
in the meantime the two little ducklings had fallen asleep
muttered the witch i think ill go in and see
looking for her little ones she called and she searched
the king heard the sad complaint of the white duck
always came back to the spot where her children lay
the wicked witch your lives did take the wicked witch
but the wicked witch was taken by the king's command
the beautiful trees had been robbed of all their fruit
as i had not much belief in the magician's warning
the fruit was plucked and stolen by an invisible hand
next morning not a single apple remained on the trees
the prince hastily seized the bird's wings in his hands
an evil magician has not robbed you of your fruit
when she was dying she bade me take the fruit
they spent the rest of the night in pleasant conversation
think of her sometimes if you never see her again
if it sparkles as brightly as ever go straight on
the wasp had vanished as suddenly as it had appeared
sent searchparties all over the kingdom to look for him
in another six months they had forgotten all about him
there wouldn't be one bit for each hundred of them
then he seized the hare and threw it to them
all his body was covered with prickles like a hedgehog
with this new protector iwanich wandered on through the forest
at the exit of the wood the lion stood still
which was held soon after with great pomp and magnificence
although the princess was very unhappy at leaving her husband
but on the third he could stand it no longer
on every one of which a man's skull was stuck
he seemed to be just the person to suit her
to see that neither of them runs away from you
the witch stood at her door and received him kindly
which through some mischance had been cast on the land
loosened a scale from the body of the grateful beast
came close to a farmyard the place pleased the prince
the two horses leapt suddenly on to the dry land
which hung down from the mountains in soft billowy masses
having thanked the eagle he drove them cheerfully home again
all turned out exactly as the sly fox had foreseen
this time corva received him in the most friendly manner
the witch pretended to be much astonished at his request
said that he deserved something much better than the foal
or you will fall into the power of his friends
when the magician found himself face to face with iwanich
though all his life long he had toiled and moiled
he only left his widow and son two hundred florins
a great noise of angry voices and barking of dogs
i had no money over to buy anything else with
for the ring which he wears on his little finger
in the middle of the field stood a magnificent castle
when i marry i shall present it to my bride
but as he did not trust himself as a wooer
he determined to send his old mother on the mission
why can not you marry someone in your own rank
he ordered that she should be brought into his presence
will you give your daughter to my son as wife
we will keep the wedding festivities in the new castle
but if he fails to execute this my royal command
i shall give orders that you and he are taken
away to the tarbarrel and the stake with you both
instead of a rich young prince from a foreign country
first she determined to learn the secret of his power
surround her with the state that befitted a royal princess
scratched the back of her ear with a velvet paw
together the two faithful creatures trotted off into the town
through which it dragged one by one little down feathers
if this were a moment to trouble you with riddles
as quickly as possible and after that bring musicians hither
he was seemingly making merry to the sound of music
he likewise was spellbound by the beauty of the music
summoning the people from the four corners of the kingdom
i have suffered much at the hands of your daughter
let your anger be turned to grace forgive my daughter
who begged him to help her out of the ditch
but at the same time you have a kind heart
these will help you if you are in any difficulty
he had roamed round the world for a whole year
while he himself had suffered much from want and misery
at the end of it came to the little hut
they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls
i have heard so much of your beauty and kindness
that i would very much like to enter your service
taking it out of his pocket he rang it once
i will summon all the eagles of the air together
with these words the king of the eagles flew away
then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon
as a reward you shall come to my ball tonight
i will summon all the fishes of the sea together
but my daughter can only stay with you in summer
when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow
where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence
immediately the two elder brothers determined to try their luck
he saw two beautiful fresh rolls and some cold meat
kneeling on the ground with his face to the earth
after a little time he was aroused he awoke and
who was kneeling with his ear upon the damp ground
while his other leg was tied up behind his ear
beheld a man aiming with a gun into the distance
answered the man i should finish that in one mouthful
to eat up twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread
not forgetting to take the bundle of wood with them
perhaps i shall give birth to a snow child now
in a few months she could run about and speak
for all summer she insisted on spending in the cellar
in the winter she would sleep outside in the snow
the colder it was the happier she seemed to be
who was disporting herself in the snowstorm that raged outside
the snowdaughter herself avoided him as much as she could
in summer the boy always lay out in the sun
just as the girl grew up into a beautiful woman
her father and mother both died one after the other
who had grown up in the meantime into a fine
that it was dangerous to go too close to him
the like of which had never been seen on earth
or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice
for a long time he wandered all through the world
after another ninetynine days he arrived at a golden castle
who addressed him in these words do you really imagine
if you do not succeed the sun will kill you
when he awoke a woman in black stood beside him
i command you to ride away from here at once
after a time the prince forgot all about his adventure
at last he made up his mind to marry again
who lives in a dear little hut in the wood
you will have to wait upon her and serve her
when they reached it they saw in front of them
granny our stepmother has sent us to wait upon you
it would show her the way out of the wood
in the meantime they would spin the yarn for her
so the girl set out to look for the cat
a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them
for youll find that water will stay in the sieve
as soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep
the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips
when the witch saw that the children had escaped her
said i have served you longer than i can say
so instantly they threw the handkerchief down over their shoulder
heard the broom sweeping the earth close behind them so
in which the roots and branches were so closely intertwined
that it was impossible to force a way through it
then they told their father all that they had suffered
they prayed heaven every day to send them a child
but how did you manage to get back so quickly
i must go home and give your mother a message
but one owned four horses and the other only one
the one who had four horses was called big klaus
looking at the roof it will make a splendid bed
spread with wine and roast meat and a beautiful fish
the farmer's wife and the sexton sat at the table
but when they heard the farmer coming they were frightened
but she put the food at once on the table
he will show himself in the shape of a sexton
treading on the sack and putting his ear to it
you shall have the wizard for a bushel of money
dragging it along i will throw it into the river
in the night as he sat there the door opened
so he went himself to little klaus with the measure
the road passed by the church the organ was sounding
with snowwhite hair and a long staff in his hand
these pushed against the sack so that it was overturned
i am so old and yet i can not die
called out little klaus creep in here instead of me
that must be because i heard part of the service
for he thought little klaus was inside down you go
because now i am on dry land and really rich
how frightened i was when i was in the sack
immediately the sack opened the loveliest maiden in snowwhite garments
a mile farther down the road there is another herd
what fine cattle were grazing in the ditches and dykes
i will throw you in with the greatest of pleasure
for i am afraid i may not reach the bottom
by this time they were far away from any house
the prince went up to her and saluted her politely
saw lying at the bottom an unusually beautiful gold ring
saying that now he could take up his quarters there
how many days he spent thus he could not tell
having done so he was able to get on shore
he one day heard a great noise in the forest
so that he ran to hide himself among the trees
she could have it to help her in the house
after this the giant accompanied him down to the sea
you must ask the king to keep us all winter
to give you a little room for both of us
found that ring's woodheap was more than twice as big
bring you the horns and the hides in the evening
no one has ever yet ventured to go against them
red answered that he had only one life to lose
bring their horns and hides to him in the evening
each of them then began to flay their own ox
red said that he had just remembered the gold cloak
for he saw he was in a great difficulty but
now you must first of all go about the neighbourhood
until they came to the foot of a steep cliff
now you must empty all the salt into the porridgepot
the girl took the gold and ran out with it
the old hag began now to long for the water
but at that moment ring and snati sprang upon him
the old troll now went out with the gold chessboard
after a hard struggle they mastered him a second time
no sooner did the hag see them than she said
sprang at her with a redhot iron from the fire
while ring kept pouring boiling porridge on her without stopping
then they burned the old troll and her to ashes
so that he esteemed him still more highly than before
while the prince should sleep where the dog usually lay
that he deserved more from him than that came to
said he would soon find out the truth about it
had just told ring what had happened during the night
so that you might not free me from the spell
his sister ingiborg and his father's kingdom to look after
on the grave of the prince's father grew a rosetree
this rose and this nightingale the princess was to have
now the princess came walking past with all her ladiesinwaiting
whether it was at the chancellor's or at the shoemaker's
polkas which had ever been known since the world began
said the ladyinwaiting who had gone down to ask him
ten kisses the rest he can take from my ladiesinwaiting
but we don't at all like being kissed by him
so the ladiesinwaiting had to go down to him again
then she stood still and wept the swineherd was scolding
looking so beautiful that the princess was obliged to courtesy
she had to stay outside singing where's my augustus dear
so he travelled through the whole world to find one
then she put twenty mattresses on top of the pea
the next morning she was asked how she had slept
no one but a true princess could be so sensitive
when he heard a window being opened high above him
off he went without saying a word to the irishman
as soon as day came he also saw the castle
he asked if she would give him food and drink
with diamond rings hanging at every loop of the curtains
when she saw that he was not eating at all
what is the spell that has been laid on you
said he i will take on hand to do it
the irishman was little more than alive by this time
rubbed him from head to foot with something from it
saying that the next night would not be so bad
was determined to be off and stay there no longer
the princess came to see if he was still alive
she found him lying on the floor as if dead
she tried to see if there was breath in him
accordingly she poured what was in the bottle on him
i have been going about for the last three years
if there is such a place on earth at all
said the old man i can do better than that
i have a book of the history of the world
if there is such a place in it at all
i am master of all the birds in the world
said the old man and what are they doing there
but he was unable to make any better of it
to enable them to get on to the eagle's back
fortunately the points of his toes just touched the bottom
the wedding of the princess was just about to begin
this happened to be the house of the king's henwife
which you can open the keys are in the locks
put him on my apron and he won't touch you
for he had never seen a dog like this before
with all that he could buy up the whole town
but he tied up all his gold in her apron
they told him she lives in a great copper castle
no one except the king may go in or out
stood before him and said what does my lord command
holding a great purse full of money in his mouth
now the soldier knew what a capital tinderbox this was
there came the dog with eyes as large as saucers
but the ladyinwaiting slipped on indiarubber shoes and followed them
for now the ladyinwaiting could not find the right house
officers came out to see where the princess had been
so that he might have had her for his wife
the shoemaker's boy was very willing to earn four shillings
said the king but the largest dog seized him too
the dogs sat at table and made eyes at everyone
he would like to see him married before he died
he came to the king and asked his daughter's hand
now the queen saw that it was a stone boat
to leave no one to watch the ship with her
found all the people sorrowful for the old king's death
although he had always been such a good child before
several planks sprang up in the floor of the room
thought that perhaps some danger was hanging over the child
came to the nurse's room a little before the time
but she refused whereupon he shut her up by herself
told her she would never get free until she consented
the real queen was now restored to all her dignity
but she did not know where to get one from
in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal
sailed from one side of the bowl to the other
the tiny thumbelina woke up very early in the morning
the old toad bowed low in the water before her
gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat
would not keep her she might go wherever she liked
she plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass
this made a forest for her to wander about in
for she was a kindhearted old thing at the bottom
you must tell him all the prettiest stories you know
now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel
in the middle of the path lay a dead swallow
it must be very miserable to be a little bird
so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried
but the bird was not dead he had been frozen
piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow
fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head
it is very cold outside it is snowing and freezing
neither the mole nor the fieldmouse learnt anything of this
she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside
or i shall bite you with my sharp white teeth
over the great mountains where the snow is always lying
if she was cold she crept under his warm feathers
the little prince was very much frightened at the swallow
the emperor's palace was the most splendid in the world
large ships could sail under the boughs of the trees
he said but he had to attend to his work
the travellers told all about it when they went home
for he liked reading the brilliant accounts of the town
the whole court shall be trampled under foot after supper
for they did not want to be trampled under foot
you shall have leave to see the emperor at dinner
for she is invited to come to court this evening
now we hear her it sounds like a little churchbell
it is wonderful that we have never heard her before
the little kitchenmaid was allowed to stand behind the door
that is the most charming coquetry i have ever seen
when two people met each other one would say nightin
it gave just as much pleasure as the real one
threeandthirty times it sang the same piece without being tired
they said and the artificial bird had to sing again
he assured them it was better than a real nightingale
for the emperor counted that side as the more distinguished
all the wheels ran down and then the music ceased
the sun was shining through the window when he awoke
i will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces
the servants came in to look at their dead emperor
hermod and hadvor often played together while they were children
after walking for some time he came to a forest
but it was not so grand as the first one's
said that in that case neither should he have hadvor
hermod has disappeared through the wicked devices of the queen
because hermod would not fall in with the queen's plans
entreated olof to think of some plan to save her
about this time the king came home from his expedition
after a time the king thought less about his disappearance
had made preparations to receive her wooer when he came
a loud noise and rumbling was heard under the castle
nor could she see any way to get up these
when evening came she heard the noise of footsteps outside
after which she heard a man coming towards the couch
then she went back into the cave and wakened hermod
asked her to help them to get to the mainland
ever so many people had tried to drive them away
with windows through which you could see into the rooms
wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it
but she had on a dress of the finest muslin
with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders
if the tinsoldier had only called out here i am
soon it began to drizzle then the drops came faster
the tinsoldier was standing up to his neck in water
she took up the soldier between her finger and thumb
he felt that he was melting but he remained steadfast
burst into flames and that was the end of her
when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes
singing so that the echoes were roused far and near
you don't find such things every day on the road
for otherwise they would have torn each other in pieces
merely because the one was in front of the other
all the country people were standing round the king's throne
replied blockheadhans then can i roast a crow with them
said the darningneedle to the fingers who were holding her
the fingers were using the needle on the cook's shoe
may i be allowed to ask if you are gold
right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out
i really believe i must have been born a sunbeam
i am not a fellow i am a young lady
even if i fell off the top of the house
i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time
let me see that would be four thousand miles down
i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth
what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking
i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime
tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat
she was close behind it when she turned the corner
how she longed to get out of that dark hall
it would be of very little use without my shoulders
how i wish i could shut up like a telescope
round the neck of the bottle was a paper label
said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope
she decided on going into the garden at once but
rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute
about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on
ive made up my mind about it if im mabel
i am so very tired of being all alone here
as she said this she looked down at her hands
alice had been to the seaside once in her life
but she remembered having seen in her brother's latin grammar
the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water
who was trembling down to the end of his tail
in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation
he says it kills all the rats and oh dear
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs
who seemed to be a person of authority among them
had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
said the duck it's generally a frog or a worm
for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english
i don't know the meaning of half those long words
the best way to explain it is to do it
when they had been running half an hour or so
saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and
let us both go to law i will prosecute you
i wonder if i shall ever see you any more
had to stoop to save her neck from being broken
the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
shall i never get any older than i am now
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs
alice could only hear whispers now and then such as
till at last it sat down a good way off
ran till she was quite tired and out of breath
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance
id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing
ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee
argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength
alice hastily replied only one doesn't like changing so often
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
just as id taken the highest tree in the wood
said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
ive seen a good many little girls in my time
that she was quite silent for a minute or two
with a little house in it about four feet high
itll never do to come upon them this size why
crept a little way out of the wood to listen
the other was sitting on the ground near the door
straight at the footman's head it just grazed his nose
broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him
nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire
there was certainly too much of it in the air
even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby
it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause
the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze
the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song
that she looked down into its face in some alarm
said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly
i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead
then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
of course just what i was going to remark myself
i think you might do something better with the time
than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers
but what happens when you come to the beginning again
feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying
why did they live at the bottom of a well
so these three little sisters they were learning to draw
alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare
they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot
said alice as she picked her way through the wood
i think i may as well go in at once
the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand
carrying the king's crown on a crimson velvet cushion and
if people had all to lie down upon their faces
she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near
the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two
said alice i don't think it's at all a pity
just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out
was in the act of crawling away besides all this
the players all played at once without waiting for turns
feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties
she did not like the look of things at all
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
went back for a little more conversation with her friend
he wasn't going to begin at his time of life
by the time he had come back with the duchess
i won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all
said the duchess and the moral of that is oh
the moral of that is take care of the sense
not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried
that's nothing to what i could say if i chose
but she did not venture to say it out loud
as pigs have to fly and the m but here
the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence
alice did not quite like the look of the creature
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock
who looked at them with large eyes full of tears
said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull
though you mayn't believe it i never said i didn't
said alice you needn't be so proud as all that
said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief
with seaography then drawling the drawlingmaster was an old congereel
the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day
but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
same as if he had a bone in his throat
you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner
very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly
ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily
that they would go with the lobsters to the dance
i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
she was a little nervous about it just at first
stand up and repeatt is the voice of the sluggard
but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille
alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing
it's by far the most confusing thing i ever heard
the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening
in the very middle of the court was a table
alice had never been in a court of justice before
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round
as well as if she were looking over their shoulders
that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation
she said to one of the officers of the court
i will just explain to you how it was done
which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
began picking them up again as quickly as she could
but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
that's not a regular rule you invented it just now
go on till you come to the end then stop
mentioned me to him she gave me a good character
that's the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
i don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it
she doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it
it goes on they all returned from him to you
at this the whole pack rose up into the air
came flying down upon her she gave a little scream
but her sister sat still just as she left her
once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee
though she knew she had but to open them again
be herself a grown woman and how she would keep
murray would never have got to college nor i either
i just wanted to go to college because murray did
im going up to the garret to think this out
if i don't come down in time to get tea
for the house is on the hill end of it
father and murray and i had always lived here together
although we were bossed by uncle abimelech more or less
murray can take or leave the farm as he chooses
but no way out of the dilemma could i see
when uncle abimelech had gone i went down to murray
it cured your sprain after you had tried everything else
one day i saw uncle abimelech striding up the lane
there is going to be a battle royal between us
old roger de melville himself never could have looked fiercer
it just means one of my ways of making money
wait for murray's until he can earn it by teaching
all day aunt martha has kept her room to rest
so i have to walk demurely and assume a virtue
while aunt andmistress saxby meander up and down the shore
then i remembered that he was probably watching me again
shut my glass up and did not touch it again
fully resolved not even to glance in the forbidden direction
but in the end i had to take a peep
i gave one frantic glance at aunt martha's rigid back
ran something like this you are not displeased with me
shall i bring her over to vouch for my character
would you object to knowing me on your own account
as we wentmistress saxby complimented me on my good colour
aunt would speedily leave him in sole possession of it
i felt my heart beating to my very finger tips
he halted by the fragment of an old stranded boat
he lifted his hat with a twinkle in his eye
would she relent ifmistress allardyce were to call for you
but i feel almost sure that she will not consent
condescendingly i think you may attend church if you wish
aunt martha and i have a battle royal over it
he waited for me at the entrance to his pew
when we went down the steps he took my hymnal
i had a hard time to get aunt martha's consent
i wouldn't have succeeded ifmistress saxby hadn't taken my part
but she will never stop trying to bring me up
the process will be going on when i am fifty
he told me how he happened to see me first
but this must not shall not be our last meeting
i unpinned the whole cluster and handed it to him
i scuttled up the lane in the most undignified fashion
but he came swiftly across the sand to meet me
i wish you wouldn't put such ideas into my head
thereby causing that poor little conscience of yours such misery
you would never see me again if you did that
when i had sobbed out my last word she rose
i saw a look of desperate determination cross his face
i could not have torn my eyes from that glass
was playing at checkers with one of the railroad men
he had a rather rough face and was flashily dressed
he just let himself be imposed upon all his life
he wasn't the kind you could forget in a hurry
i used to tell him hed be sorry for it
when left to himself he also rose and walked out
the house itself was in the shadow of the firs
he hasn't changed much except that he's got mighty grey
he drew himself softly up and sat on the fence
he was sorry he had fallen on such evil times
they would be glad of another partner with some cash
although it may be kind of hard to see it
i reckon thatll keep you out of joe moore's clutches
there's three thousand there if i ain't made a mistake
he said he had to leave on the 430 train
but im going to pull up a bit after this
cleanshaven george's island guarded the town like a sturdy bulldog
that is why i want to tell you about it
it is dreadful to be talking to you like this
i tell it out loud to myself in the glass
but please don't look at me while im telling you
it ought to have been beatrix she is the oldest
the shadow of it has been over my whole life
i never could have a single little bit of fun
she had scores of lovers in spite of her nose
as if i cared how clever or rich he is
the creature is on his way out to canada now
he must loathe and detest the very thought of me
what do you suppose he does think of it all
it's just as well to be on the safe side
the girl dragged her hat off and waved it joyously
the creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones
but her family thought her confusion very natural and pretty
they really had not expected her to behave so well
somewhat flushed and breathless from her ascent to the garret
only laughed at what she called lucy rose's finicky notions
i don't see that it's anything to be ashamed of
some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves
the presents for the children can go in on top
not having been trained under aunt cyrilla's eye for nothing
the stationmaster sold them their tickets with a grim face
a sunburned lad three seats ahead in a khaki uniform
imposing old lady in a sealskin coat ahead of him
but as the day wore on the storm grew worse
it was dusk when the conductor came through the train
these storms of late have played the mischief with everything
im just a shop girl out of work at present
let's eat it all up and have a good time
the khaki boy came up again and shared the candy
even the sealskin lady turned her head over her shoulder
one on aunt cyrilla's lap and one on lucy rose's
