had spoken so much of the great love and friendship she felt for her
that at last the mouse consented to live in the same house with her
but we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger
can not venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap
i know of no place where it could be better put than in the church
no one will trouble to take it away from there
so the little pot was placed in safety but it was not long before the cat had a great longing for it
think of me i should very much like a drop of the red christening wine
then she took a walk on the roofs of the town
licked her lips whenever she thought of the little pot of fat
as soon as it was evening she went home again
said the mouse you must certainly have had an enjoyable day
not long after this another great longing came over the cat
you must again be kind enough to look after the house alone
for i have been asked a second time to stand godmother
as this child has a white ring round its neck
but the cat slunk under the town wall to the church
soon the cat's mouth began to water once more after her licking business
she said to the mouse i have again to stand godmother
they are such curious names they make me very thoughtful
you sit at home in your dark grey coat and your long tail
the mouse had a good cleaning out while the cat was gone
made the house tidy but the greedy cat ate the fat every bit up
when it is all gone one can be at rest
the mouse asked at once after the third child's name
i do not believe that name has been printed any more than the others
from this time on no one asked the cat to stand godmother but when the winter came and there was nothing to be got outside
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored away it will taste very good
answered the cat it will taste as good to you as if you stretched your thin tongue out of the window
when they reached it they found the pot in its place
you have eaten it all when you stood godmother first the top off
scarcely was it out than the cat made a spring at her
the six swans a king was once hunting in a great wood
he hunted the game so eagerly that none of his courtiers could follow him
when evening came on he stood still and looked round him
then he saw an old woman with a shaking head coming towards him but she was a witch
can you not show me the way out of the wood
which if you do not fulfil you will never get out of the wood
who is so beautiful that she has not her equal in the world
is well fitted to be your wife if you will make her ladyqueen i will show you the way out of the wood
the old woman led him to her little house where her daughter was sitting by the fire
she received the king as if she were expecting him
he saw that she was certainly very beautiful but she did not please him
he could not look at her without a secret feeling of horror
as soon as he had lifted the maiden on to his horse the old woman showed him the way
because he was afraid that their stepmother might not treat them well and might do them harm
he put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood
but the king went so often to his dear children that the queen was offended at his absence
wanted to know what he had to do quite alone in the wood
also told her of the reel which alone could point out the way
she had no rest now till she had found out where the king guarded the reel
when the king had ridden off she took the little shirts and went into the wood
which when it had touched their bodies changed them into swans
thought she had got rid of her stepchildren but the girl had not run to meet her with her brothers
the next day the king came to visit his children
she told him that looking out of her little window she had seen her brothers flying over the wood in the shape of swans
she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the yard
but he did not think that the queen had done the wicked deed
as he was afraid the maiden would also be taken from him
begged the king to let her stay just one night more in the castle in the wood
my home is no longer here i will go and seek my brothers
she ran all through the night and the next day
but when the sun had set she heard a noise
they stood on the floor and blew at one another
her brothers were not less delighted than she to see their little sister again
this is a den of robbers if they were to come here and find you they would kill you
for we can only lay aside our swan skins for a quarter of an hour every evening
must make in that time six shirts for us out of starflowers
when the brothers had said this the quarter of an hour came to an end
but the maiden had determined to free her brothers even if it should cost her her life
it happened that the king of the country was hunting in the forest
his hunters came to the tree on which the maiden sat
her modest ways and behaviour pleased him so much that he said
i will marry this maiden and none other in the world
but the king had a wicked mother who was displeased with the marriage
then she went to the king and said that the queen had killed it
but she sat quietly sewing at the shirts and troubling herself about nothing
the next time she had a child the wicked mother did the same thing
but the king could not make up his mind to believe her
she is too sweet and good to do such a thing as that
the king was obliged to give her over to the law
when the day came on which the sentence was to be executed
it was the last day of the six years in which she must not speak or laugh
now she had freed her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment
the six shirts were done there was only the left sleeve wanting to the last
as she stood on the pile and the fire was about to be lighted
she looked around her and saw six swans flying through the air
then she knew that her release was at hand and her heart danced for joy
hovered low so that she could throw the shirts over them
only the youngest had a swan's wing instead of his left arm
now i can speak and tell you openly that i am innocent and have been falsely accused
how she had taken the three children away and hidden them
but the king and the queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace
with every spring it covered half a mile of ground
was to remain for several years in the same place
not to move on till the whole neighbourhood was eaten up
which were harder than stone or metal its two great eyes shone by night
anyone who had the ill luck to look into those eyes became as it were bewitched
was obliged to rush of his own accord into the monster's jaws
in this way the dragon was able to feed upon both men and beasts without the least trouble to itself
as it needed not to move from the spot where it was lying
all the neighbouring kings had offered rich rewards to anyone who should be able to destroy the monster
once a great forest in which the dragon lay had been set on fire the forest was burnt down
but the fire did not do the monster the least harm
there was a tradition amongst the wise men of the country that the dragon might be overcome by one who possessed king solomon's signetring
this inscription would enable anyone who was wise enough to interpret it to find out how the dragon could be destroyed
nor was there any sorcerer or learned man to be found who would be able to explain the inscription
because he knew that all the wisdom of old time comes from the east
after some years he met with a famous eastern magician
but the birds of the air would be better guides to you if you could learn their language
i can help you to understand it if you will stay with me a few days
i can not now offer you any reward for your kindness
but should my undertaking succeed your trouble shall be richly repaid
then the magician brewed a powerful potion out of nine sorts of herbs which he had gathered himself all alone by moonlight
he gave the youth nine spoonfuls of it daily for three days
which made him able to understand the language of birds
if you ever find solomon's ring and get possession of it
that i may explain the inscription on the ring to you
for there is no one else in the world who can do this
from that time the youth never felt lonely as he walked along he always had company
because he understood the language of birds and in this way he learned many things which mere human knowledge could never have taught him
had sat down under a tree in a forest to eat his supper
sitting at the top of the tree talking to one another about him
the first bird said i know that wandering fool under the tree there
who has come so far without finding what he seeks
who will doubtless be able to put him on the right track
but in three nights from now she will come to the spring to wash her face
as she does every month when the moon is full
in order that she may never grow old nor wrinkled
shall we go and see how it is she does it
the youth immediately resolved to follow the birds to the spring
since he had not wings to carry him along so swiftly
when with the earliest dawn he looked up to the treetop
he was glad to see his feathered companions still asleep with their heads under their wings
they hopped about from one tree to another looking for food
when they went back to their old perch to sleep
but on the third morning one bird said to the other
today we must go to the spring to see the witchmaiden wash her face
they remained on the tree till noon then they flew away and went towards the south
the young man's heart beat with anxiety lest he should lose sight of his guides
but he managed to keep the birds in view until they again perched upon a tree
the young man ran after them until he was quite exhausted and out of breath
after three short rests the birds at length reached a small open space in the forest
on the edge of which they placed themselves on the top of a high tree
he saw that there was a clear spring in the middle of the space
he sat down at the foot of the tree upon which the birds were perched
listened attentively to what they were saying to each other
said the first bird we must wait yet awhile till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring
do you think she will see that young man sitting under the tree
will the youth have the sense not to let himself be caught in her toils
the full moon was already shining down upon the forest
after a few moments there came out of the forest a maiden
gliding over the grass so lightly that her feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground
the youth could not turn away his eyes from the maiden
for he had never in his life seen a woman so beautiful
then looked up to the moon again and walked nine times round the well
as she walked she sang this song fullfaced moon with light unshaded
when her eye suddenly fell upon the spot where the young man was sitting
you ought to have a heavy punishment because you have presumed to watch my secret doings in the moonlight
but you must tell me truly who you are and how you came to this place
at your coming i did not know what to do
because i thought my silent watching could not offend you
you will sleep better on a pillow than on damp moss
but presently he heard the birds saying from the top of the tree
which glittered in the moonlight as if it was all built out of gold and silver
at length they reached a chamber where a table was spread with the most costly dishes
yet he seemed to hear a voice near his bed which repeated to him
the next morning the maiden asked him whether he would not like to stay with her always in this beautiful place
she continued you see how i always remain young and beautiful
but from the moment i saw you i took a fancy to you
we might be married and might live together like princes
the youth could not but be tempted with the beautiful maiden's offer
but he remembered how the birds had called her the witch
if i do not decide immediately on this important matter
give me a few days to consider before we come to an understanding
she took the youth over every part of her beautiful dwelling
but the youth did not know this he thought they were all real
one day the maiden took him into a secret chamber
where a little gold box was standing on a silver table
whose like is not to be found in the whole world
i will give you this ring as a marriage gift
but in order that our love may last for ever
you must give me for the ring three drops of blood from the little finger of your left hand
when the youth heard these words a cold shudder ran over him
to conceal his feelings and to make no direct answer
no mortal is able entirely to understand the power of this ring
because no one thoroughly understands the secret signs engraved upon it
but even with my halfknowledge i can work great wonders
if i put the ring upon the little finger of my left hand
then i can fly like a bird through the air wherever i wish to go
if i put it on the third finger of my left hand i am invisible
if i put the ring upon the middle finger of my left hand
then neither fire nor water nor any sharp weapon can hurt me
if i put it on the forefinger of my left hand
then i can with its help produce whatever i wish
i can in a single moment build houses or anything i desire
as long as i wear the ring on the thumb of my left hand
that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks and walls
but it is not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands it is supposed that an angel gave it to the wise king
when the youth heard all this he determined to try and get possession of the ring
though he did not quite believe in all its wonderful gifts
he wished the maiden would let him have it in his hand
but he did not quite like to ask her to do so
after a while she put it back into the box
a few days after they were again speaking of the magic ring
i do not think it possible that the ring can have all the power you say it has
then the maiden opened the box and took the ring out
it glittered as she held it like the clearest sunbeam
she put it on the middle finger of her left hand
told the youth to take a knife and try as hard as he could to cut her with it
but an invisible wall of iron seemed to be between them
asked what finger he must put the ring on so that no sharp weapon could hurt him
she took the knife and tried to strike the youth
then he asked the maiden to show him how to split stones and rocks with the help of the ring
so she led him into a courtyard where stood a great boulderstone
put the ring upon the thumb of your left hand
found to his astonishment that with a single blow of his fist the stone flew into a thousand pieces
then the youth bethought him that he who does not use his luck when he has it is a fool
that this was a chance which once lost might never return
so while they stood laughing at the shattered stone he placed the ring
you are invisible to me until you take the ring off again
but the youth had no mind to do that on the contrary
then put the ring on the little finger of his left hand
when the maiden saw him flying away she thought at first that he was still in play
for now you see i have told you the truth
bitterly repented that she had ever trusted him with the ring
the young man never halted in his flight until he reached the dwelling of the wise magician who had taught him the speech of birds
the magician was delighted to find that his search had been successful
at once set to work to interpret the secret signs engraved upon the ring
but it took him seven weeks to make them out clearly
then he gave the youth the following instructions how to overcome the dragon of the north you must have an iron horse cast
you must also be armed with a spear two fathoms long
which you will be able to wield by means of the magic ring upon your left thumb
the spear must be as thick in the middle as a large tree
in the middle of the spear you must have two strong chains ten fathoms in length
as soon as the dragon has made himself fast to the spear
you must spring quickly from the iron horse and fasten the ends of the chains firmly to the ground with iron stakes
after two or three days the monster's strength will be so far exhausted that you will be able to come near him
then you can put solomon's ring upon your left thumb and give him the finishing stroke
but keep the ring on your third finger until you have come close to him
else he might strike you dead with his long tail
i have profited so much by the wisdom the ring has taught me that i desire no other reward
he heard people say that the terrible dragon of the north was not far off
the king announced publicly that he would give his daughter in marriage
the youth then went to the king and told him that he had good hopes of subduing the dragon
if the king would grant him all he desired for the purpose
it was found that the iron horse was so heavy that a hundred men could not move it from the spot
so the youth found there was nothing for it but to move it with his own strength by means of the magic ring
the dragon was now so near that in a couple of springs he would be over the frontier
the youth now began to consider how he should act
for if he had to push the iron horse from behind he could not ride upon it as the sorcerer had said he must
but a raven unexpectedly gave him this advice ride upon the horse
as if you were pushing off a boat from the land
found that in this way he could easily move forwards
man and horse would have been swallowed up by them
he brought it down with all his might right through the monster's lower jaw
then quick as lightning he sprang from his horse before the dragon had time to shut his mouth
now warned him that the dragon's jaws had closed upon the spear
when the youth turned round he saw the point of the spear sticking up high above the dragon's upper jaw
knew that the other end must be fastened firmly to the ground but the dragon had got his teeth fixed in the iron horse
the youth now hastened to fasten down the chains to the ground by means of the enormous iron pegs which he had provided
the death struggle of the monster lasted three days and three nights in his writhing he beat his tail so violently against the ground
that at ten miles distance the earth trembled as if with an earthquake
when he at length lost power to move his tail
the youth with the help of the ring took up a stone which twenty ordinary men could not have moved
beat the dragon so hard about the head with it that very soon the monster lay lifeless before him
you can fancy how great was the rejoicing when the news was spread abroad that the terrible monster was dead
his conqueror was received into the city with as much pomp as if he had been the mightiest of kings
the old king did not need to urge his daughter to marry the slayer of the dragon he found her already willing to bestow her hand upon this hero
who had done all alone what whole armies had tried in vain to do
for all the neighbouring kings had met together to thank the man who had freed the world from their common enemy
but everyone forgot amid the general joy that they ought to have buried the dragon's monstrous body
for it began now to have such a bad smell that no one could live in the neighbourhood
a pestilence broke out which destroyed many hundreds of people
the king's soninlaw resolved to seek help once more from the eastern magician
to whom he at once travelled through the air like a bird by the help of the ring
but there is a proverb which says that illgotten gains never prosper
the prince found that the stolen ring brought him illluck after all
the witchmaiden had never rested night nor day until she had found out where the ring was
as soon as she had discovered by means of magical arts that the prince in the form of a bird was on his way to the eastern magician
she changed herself into an eagle and watched in the air until the bird she was waiting for came in sight
for she knew him at once by the ring which was hung round his neck by a ribbon
the moment she seized him in her talons she tore the ring from his neck before the man in bird's shape had time to prevent her
then the eagle flew down to the earth with her prey
the two stood face to face once more in human form
do you expect to live happily as the king's soninlaw
now the tables are turned you are in my power
cried the prince i know too well how deeply i have wronged you
if i were to spare you everyone would think me a fool
you have doubly wronged me first you scorned my love
with these words she put the ring upon her left thumb
this time she did not take him to a splendid palace
the maiden now chained the young man's hands and feet so that he could not escape then she said in an angry voice
i will bring you every day enough food to prevent you dying of hunger
the old king and his daughter waited anxiously for many weeks for the prince's return
the king's daughter often dreamed that her husband was going through some great suffering she therefore begged her father to summon all the enchanters and magicians
that they might try to find out where the prince was and how he could be set free
except that he was still living and undergoing great suffering but none could tell where he was to be found
at last a celebrated magician from finland was brought before the king
who had found out that the king's soninlaw was imprisoned in the east
the king now sent messengers to the east to look for his soninlaw
they by good luck met with the old magician who had interpreted the signs on king solomon's ring
thus was possessed of more wisdom than anyone else in the world
the magician soon found out what he wished to know
after some days came to the cave where the unfortunate prince had been chained up for nearly seven years
took care of the prince until he recovered and became strong enough to travel
when he reached home he found that the old king had died that morning
which lasted to the end of his life but he never got back the magic ring
nor has it ever again been seen by mortal eyes
would you not rather have stayed with the pretty witchmaiden
many years ago there lived an emperor who was so fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on them in order to be beautifully dressed
he did not care about the theatre he only liked to go out walking to show off his new clothes
he had a coat for every hour of the day and just as they say of a king
in the great city in which he lived there was always something going on every day many strangers came there
one day two impostors arrived who gave themselves out as weavers
said that they knew how to manufacture the most beautiful cloth imaginable
but the clothes which were made of the stuff possessed this wonderful property that they were invisible to anyone who was not fit for his office
if i had them on i could find out which men in my kingdom are unfit for the offices they hold i could distinguish the wise from the stupid
but they had not the least thing on the looms
they also demanded the finest silk and the best gold
worked at the empty looms till late into the night
i should like very much to know how far they have got on with the cloth
but he remembered when he thought about it that whoever was stupid or not fit for his office would not be able to see it
now he certainly believed that he had nothing to fear for himself
but he wanted first to send somebody else in order to see how he stood with regard to his office
everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful power the cloth had
they were all curious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbour was
i will send my old and honoured minister to the weavers
now the good old minister went into the hall where the two impostors sat working at the empty weavinglooms
both the impostors begged him to be so kind as to step closer
asked him if it were not a beautiful texture and lovely colours
the poor old minister went forward rubbing his eyes but he could see nothing
i must certainly not say that i can not see the cloth
i will tell the emperor that it pleases me very much
thereupon they named the colours and explained the make of the texture
so that he could tell the same to the emperor when he came back to him
the emperor soon sent another worthy statesman to see how the weaving was getting on
it was the same with him as the first one he looked and looked
but because there was nothing on the empty loom he could see nothing
they pointed to and described the splendid material which was not there
so it must be my good office for which i am not fitted
so he praised the cloth which he did not see
expressed to them his delight at the beautiful colours and the splendid texture
everybody in the town was talking of the magnificent cloth
now the emperor wanted to see it himself while it was still on the loom
amongst whom were both the worthy statesmen who had already been there before
said both the old statesmen who had already been there
for they believed that the others could see the cloth quite well
that were the most dreadful thing that could happen to me
for he would not say that he could see nothing
saw no more than the others but they said like the emperor
they advised him to wear these new and magnificent clothes for the first time at the great procession which was soon to take place
went from mouth to mouth everyone seemed delighted over them
the emperor gave to the impostors the title of court weavers to the emperor
throughout the whole of the night before the morning on which the procession was to take place
the impostors were up and were working by the light of over sixteen candles
the people could see that they were very busy making the emperor's new clothes ready
they pretended they were taking the cloth from the loom
each impostor held up his arm just as if he were holding something
spun clothes are so comfortable that one would imagine one had nothing on at all but that is the beauty of it
will it please your majesty graciously to take off your clothes
the impostors placed themselves before him as if they were putting on each part of his new clothes which was ready
the emperor turned and bent himself in front of the mirror
they are waiting outside with the canopy which your majesty is wont to have borne over you in the procession
he turned himself again to the mirror to see if his finery was on all right
they would not have it noticed that they could see nothing
so the emperor went along in the procession under the splendid canopy
all the people in the streets and at the windows said
no one wished it to be noticed that he could see nothing
for then he would have been unfit for his office
none of the emperor's clothes had met with such approval as these had
each one whispered to his neighbour what the child had said
for it seemed to him as if they were right but he thought to himself
holding up the train which was not there at all
once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children
when he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish
but he kept the crab separate because it shone so beautifully
had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible
let down thy petticoat that lets thy feet be seen
for she was not quite pleased at the crab's remarks
then she took him up and placed him on a dish
when her husband came home and they sat down to dinner
when the old man came to take away the plate which had contained the crab's dinner
as the same thing happened every day he soon became very fond of the crab
go to the king and tell him i wish to marry his younger daughter
who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab
knew that the crab was likely to be a prince in disguise
tell the crab i will give him my daughter if by tomorrow morning he can build a wall in front of my castle much higher than my tower
upon which all the flowers of the world must grow and bloom
go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the king showed you
then the old woman went back to the king and said to him
but i can not give away my daughter until there stands in front of my palace a garden in which there are three fountains
so the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod
now take this rod go and knock with it on a certain mountain then a black man will come out and ask you what you wish for
has sent me to tell you that you must send him his golden garment that is like the sun
the queenly robes of gold and precious stones which are like the flowery meadows
the crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion
in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle
where the crab presented the other garment to his bride
when the married pair were alone together the crab made himself known to his young wife
told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world
so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished
no sooner had he said this than he shook himself
but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crabshell
but her mother still thought the whole matter very strange
at last she said to the king that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the crab
but when the daughter was questioned she only answered i am married to the crab
i will invite all the princes in the world to it
in the evening the princess told this to the crab
then a black man will come out and say to you
answer him thus your master the king has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple
the following evening the prince dressed himself for the tournament
now mind you do not say when you see me that i am the crab
for if you do this evil will come of it
place yourself at the window with your sisters i will ride by and throw you the silver apple
the princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament
presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her
she caught it in her hand and went with it to her room
but her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the princes he therefore appointed a second tournament
the crab then gave his wife the same directions as before
only this time the apple which she received from the black man was of gold
but before the prince went to the tournament he said to his wife
but she swore to him that she would not tell who he was
the prince suddenly galloped past on his steed and threw her the golden apple
her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner
ran into her daughter's room where the crabshell was still lying
but it was of no use her husband did not come back
now we must leave the princess and turn to the other persons in the story
one day an old man went to a stream to dip in a crust of bread which he was going to eat
he found in a large hall a table set for twelve persons
he hid himself in the hall behind a great picture
when he took courage to look out from behind the picture
the eagles flew to the basin of a fountain that was there and bathed themselves
one of them took up a goblet filled with wine
then one of them said a health to my dearest lady
but a curse on the cruel mother that burnt my golden shell
that the only thing that did her good was having stories told to her
told her about the strange things he had seen in the underground palace
no sooner had he finished than the princess asked him whether he could find the way to that palace
now she desired him to guide her thither at once
when they came to the palace he hid her behind the great picture and advised her to keep quite still
in a moment the princess recognised her husband amongst them all
tried to come out of her hidingplace but the old man held her back
the youths seated themselves at the table and now the prince said again
while he took up the cup of wine a health to my dearest lady
but ran forward and threw her arms round her husband
said do you remember how i told you that day that you would betray me
now listen to me i must still remain enchanted for three months
will you stay here with me till that time is over
go back to the castle and tell my parents that i am staying here
her parents were very much vexed when the old man came back and told them this
but as soon as the three months of the prince's enchantment were over
he ceased to be an eagle and became once more a man
once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king's son who was enchanted by an old witch
so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood
at last a king's daughter came into the wood she had lost her way
she had been wandering round and round for nine days
if you will promise to do what i ask you
i am a greater prince than you are a princess
what can a young lassie do with an iron stove
but as she wanted very much to go home to her father
bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron
but he brought her in two hours to her house
there was great joy in the castle when the princess came back
the old king fell on her neck and kissed her
i should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if i had not come to an iron stove
to whom i have had to promise that i will go back to free him and marry him
the old king was so frightened that he nearly fainted
it seems so to me i think i hear my father's mill rattling
told the old king that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her
but they had a swineherd's daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller's daughter
they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the princess
as soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out
it seems so to me too i think i hear my father blowing his horn
say to her that what i foretell shall come to pass
if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin
but it was no good she had to keep her word
as soon as she reached it she began to scrape
the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole
then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot
made the hole so large that he could get out
i am thine you are my bride and have set me free
he wanted to take her with him to his kingdom
but she begged him just to let her go once more to her father and the prince let her go
but told her not to say more than three words to her father
she said more than three words and immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a mountain of glass and sharp swords
went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove but she could not find it
then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer
when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come
when midnight came she saw afar off a little light
then she got down from the tree and went towards the light
she came to a little old house with a great deal of grass growing round
peeped through the window but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads
then a fat toad called out little green toad with leg like crook
they asked her how she came there and what she wanted
because she had exceeded her permission only to speak three words
the stove had disappeared with the prince and how she had searched a very long time
must wander over mountain and valley till she found him
then the old toad said little green toad whose leg doth twist
the little toad went and brought out a great chest
led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite
the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her
when she had passed these she would find her lover again
when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind her feet and then in front
when she was on the other side put them carefully away
she went in and gave herself out as a servant
but she knew that the prince whom she had freed from the iron stove in the great wood was in the castle
so she was taken on as a kitchenmaid for very small wages
she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her
she cracked one and was going to eat the kernel
saying that it was not a dress for a servingmaid
then she said she would not sell it unless she was granted one favour namely
because the dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it
but she gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleepingdraught
but he slept so soundly that she could not wake him
i freed you in the wild wood out of the iron stove i have sought you
the servants outside heard how she cried the whole night
when she had washed up the next evening she bit the second nut
when the bride saw it she wanted to buy it also
asked that she should sleep again by the prince's door
i have freed you in a wood and from an iron stove i sought you and have crossed a glassy mountain
when she had washed up on the third night she bit the third nut
there was a still more beautiful dress inside that was made of pure gold
when the bride saw it she wanted to have it
but the maid would only give it her on condition that she should sleep for the third time by the prince's door
but the prince took care not to drink the sleepingdraught
when they came to the great lake they rowed across
when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on the ploughwheel
on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in
so they arrived at last at the little old house
but when they stepped inside it turned into a large castle
which was much larger than that of the princess's father's
but because the old man did not like being left alone
so they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth
the dragon and his grandmother there was once a great war
but he gave them so little pay that they could not live upon it
then three of them took counsel together and determined to desert
we shall be hanged on the gallows how shall we set about it
they sat for two days and two nights in the corn
grew so hungry that they nearly died but if they were to venture out
whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air
now if we remain here we shall die of hunger
if we move out we shall be strung up on the gallows
i will lead you through the midst of the army so that no one shall catch you
set them down on the earth a long way from it
as much money as you want will jump up before you
when the seven years were nearly ended two of them grew terribly anxious and frightened
then they told her that they had become the servants of the dragon for seven long years
how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries but as they had signed their names they were his
unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle
there he will come upon a tumbledown building of rocks which looks like a little house
but the third and merry one jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut
because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him
she lifted up a large stone which lay over the cellar
hide yourself there you can hear all that is spoken in this room
for he tells me everything then listen carefully what he answers
then in the course of the conversation she asked him what he had done in the day
for i shall only give them one riddle which they will never be able to guess
his old grandmother pulled up the stone and let out the soldier
then he went by another way through the window secretly
he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother
how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle
cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground
i will take you underground with me you shall have a meal there
if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat
in the north sea lies a dead seacat that shall be the roast meat
the rib of a whale shall be our silver spoon
the donkey cabbage there was once a young hunter who went boldly into the forest
as he went whistling along there came an ugly old woman
he felt in his pocket and gave her all he could spare
because of your kind heart i will make you a present
in a short time you will come to a tree on which sit nine birds who have a cloak in their claws and are quarrelling over it
then take aim with your gun and shoot in the middle of them they will let the cloak fall
but one of the birds will be hit and will drop down dead
when you throw it on your shoulders you have only to wish yourself at a certain place
take the heart out of the dead bird and swallow it whole
early every morning when you get up you will find a gold piece under your pillow
thought to himself these are splendid things she has promised me
then he heard above him in the branches such a screaming and chirping that he looked up
there he saw a heap of birds tearing a cloth with their beaks and feet
it is just as the old woman said and he took his gun on his shoulder
then the hunter did as the old woman had told him he cut open the bird
the next morning when he awoke he remembered the promise
what good is all my gold to me if i stay at home
i will travel and look a bit about me in the world
it happened that one day he went through a thick wood
when he came to the end of it there lay in the plain before him a large castle
at one of the windows in it stood an old woman with a most beautiful maiden by her side
there comes one out of the wood who has a wonderful treasure in his body which we must manage to possess ourselves of
darling daughter we have more right to it than he
so every morning there lies a gold piece under his pillow
she told her how they could get hold of it
i have travelled so far now that i will rest
turn into this beautiful castle money i have in plenty
but the real reason was that he had caught sight of the lovely face
it was not long before he was so much in love with the witchmaiden that he thought of nothing else
now we must have the birdheart he will not feel when it is gone
when it was ready she poured it in a goblet and gave it to the maiden
when he had swallowed the drink the birdheart came out of his mouth
the maiden had to get hold of it secretly and then swallow it herself
it lay under the maiden's but he was so much in love and so much bewitched that he thought of nothing except spending all his time with the maiden
we will leave him that he has already lost his wealth
said that if she did not obey it would go ill with her
she looked away into the far distance as if she were very sad
over there lies the granite mountain where the costly precious stones grow
so that when i think of it i am very sad
so he wrapped her round in his cloak and wished themselves to the granite mountain
the precious stones sparkled so brightly on all sides that it was a pleasure to see them
but now the old witch had through her caused the hunter's eyes to become heavy
we will sit down for a little while and rest i am so tired that i can hardly stand on my feet
he laid his head on her lap and fell asleep
as soon as he was sound asleep she unfastened the cloak from his shoulders
but when the hunter had finished his sleep and awoke
he found that his love had betrayed him and left him alone on the wild mountain
he had not sat long before he saw three of them striding towards him
so he lay down as if he had fallen into a deep sleep
if he goes higher up the mountain the clouds will take him and carry him off
as soon as they had gone he rose and climbed to the summit
when he had sat there a little while a cloud swept by
then it sank down and hovered over a large vegetable garden surrounded by walls
so that he came safely to the ground amidst cabbages and vegetables
for i see here not an apple or pear or fruit of any kind nothing but vegetables everywhere
at a pinch i can eat a salad it does not taste particularly nice
so he looked about for a good head and ate it
but no sooner had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange
he saw with horror that he had changed into a donkey
but as he was still very hungry and this juicy salad tasted very good to his present nature
at last he got hold of another kind of cabbage
but scarcely had swallowed it when he felt another change
the hunter now lay down and slept off his weariness
when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head of the bad and a head of the good cabbage
when he had wandered about for a couple of days he found it quite easily
so that his own mother would not have known him
have been sent to seek the finest salad that grows under the sun
am bringing it with me but the heat of the sun is so great that the tender cabbage threatens to grow soft
i do not know if i shall be able to bring it any farther
when the old witch heard of the fine salad she wanted to eat it
he opened his sack and gave her the bad one
so that she went into the kitchen to prepare it herself
when it was ready she could not wait till it was served at the table
but she immediately took a couple of leaves and put them in her mouth
ran into the courtyard in the shape of a donkey
when she saw the salad standing there ready cooked she was about to carry it up
the dish with the salad in it fell to the ground
i will go to the kitchen and fetch it myself
when he came there he saw the two donkeys running about in the courtyard
he laid them on the dish and brought them to the maiden
i am bringing you the delicious food my own self
the miller put his head out and asked what he wanted
one beating and three meals and to the youngest one
no beating and three meals for he could not find it in his heart to let the maiden be beaten
but they are so sad that they can not last much longer
when they came he gave them some of the good cabbage to eat
then the beautiful maiden fell on her knees before him
my mother compelled me to do it it was against my will
as for the birdheart i will make a drink and give it back to you
for i will take you to be my own dear true wife
in a part of the world whose name i forget lived once upon a time two kings
both were under the protection of the fairies though it is only fair to say that the fairies did not love them half so well as their wives did
now it often happens that as princes can generally manage to get their own way it is harder for them to be good than it is for common people
so it was with peridor and diamantino but of the two
the fairies declared that diamantino was much the worst indeed
that the fairies would not allow him to live any longer and he died
of course this little girl was the heiress of the kingdom
the only thing she had to vex her was the absence of her daughter for the fairies
determined to bring up the little princess serpentine among themselves
when she was gone the king felt how much he had loved her
his grief was so great that his subjects called him peridor the sorrowful
it seems hardly possible that any man should live like peridor for fifteen years plunged in such depth of grief
most likely he would have died too if it had not been for the fairies
the one comfort the poor king had was his son
who was only three years old at the time of his mother's death
by the time he was fifteen saphir had learnt everything that a prince should know
it was about this time that the fairies suddenly took fright lest his love for his father should interfere with the plans they had made for the young prince
they placed in a pretty little room of which saphir was very fond a little mirror in a black frame
the prince did not notice for some days that there was anything new in the room
what was his surprise to see reflected in the mirror
but that of a young girl as lovely as the morning
the young prince lost his heart completely to the beautiful image
it was impossible to get him out of the room
certainly it was very delightful to be able to see her whom he loved at any moment he chose
but his spirits sometimes sank when he wondered what was to be the end of this adventure
the magic mirror had been for about a year in the prince's possession
when one day a new subject of disquiet seized upon him
when suddenly he thought he saw a second mirror reflected in the first
the young girl had only possessed it for a short time
neglected all her duties for the sake of the mirror
now it was not difficult for saphir to guess the reason of the change in her
nor why the new mirror was consulted so often but try as he would he could never see the face of the person who was reflected in it
all he knew was that the face was that of a man
we must suppose that they had their reasons for acting as they did
when these things happened saphir was about eighteen years old
fifteen years had passed away since the death of his mother
king peridor had grown more and more unhappy as time went on
at last he fell so ill that it seemed as if his days were numbered
he was so much beloved by his subjects that this sad news was heard with despair by the nation
during his whole illness the king never spoke of anything but the queen
all the doctors and all the watercures in the kingdom had been tried
at last he persuaded them to let him lie quietly in his room
perhaps the worst pain he had to bear was a sort of weight on his chest
so he commanded his servants to leave the windows open in order that he might get more air
when he had been left alone for a few minutes
a bird with brilliant plumage came and fluttered round the window
his feet and his beak of such glittering rubies that no one could bear to look at them
i can not tell you what the crown was made of
but i am quite certain that it was still more splendid than all the rest
as to his voice i can say nothing about that
in a little while the bird flew into the room
at every glance the strength of the sick man became greater
till he was once more as well as he used to be before the queen died
he tried to seize the bird to whom he owed it all
who rushed at his first call in vain they sought the wonderful creature both on horse and foot
summoned the fowlers to their aid the bird could nowhere be found
the love the people bore king peridor was so strong
the king soon fell back into the same condition as he was in before
was so unhappy at this that he persuaded himself that he might succeed where the others had failed
there was no reason that he should choose one path more than another
his only idea was to make straight for those spots which were the favourite haunts of birds
but in vain he examined all the hedges and all the thickets in vain he questioned everyone he met along the road
at last he came to one of the largest forests in all the world
but in spite of the deep shadows cast by the widespreading branches of the trees
it seemed to saphir that this was exactly the place where the birds would choose to live
he determined not to quit the wood until he had examined it from end to end
he ordered some nets to be prepared and painted of the same colours as the bird's plumage
thinking that we are all easily caught by what is like ourselves
in this he had to help him not only the fowlers by profession
for a man is not a courtier unless he can do everything
after searching as usual for nearly a whole day prince saphir began to feel overcome with thirst
when happily he discovered a little way off a bubbling fountain of the clearest water
saphir shook it impatiently off but it was no good
when the little creature fixed upon him the most beautiful eyes in the world
i am a friend of the bird you are seeking
be sure you do exactly in every respect what i tell you
order them to remain in a little hamlet close by until you want them
down a road that you will find on your right hand
this road is planted all the way with cedars of lebanon and after going down it a long way you will come at last to a magnificent castle
put it into the ground as close as you can to the gate of the castle
it has the virtue both of opening the gate and also of sending to sleep all the inhabitants
pay no heed to anything except what i tell you
with these words the little frog plunged into the water and disappeared
who felt more hopeful than he had done since he left home
at last he arrived at the gate of the castle
already had his hand on the finest horse it contained
when his eye was caught by a suit of magnificent harness hanging up close by
it occurred to him directly that the harness belonged to the horse
who could only find very lame excuses for his conduct
the lord of the castle took a fancy to his face
very much ashamed of himself poor saphir crept back to the fountain
where the frog was awaiting him with a good scolding
do you really believe that it was just for the pleasure of talking that i gave you the advice you have neglected so abominably
that after some time the heart of the good little frog was softened
but instead of being sand it was now a grain of gold
she directed him to do just as he had done before
that instead of going to the stable which had been the ruin of his hopes
to glide as fast as he could down the passages till he came to a room filled with perfume
where he would find a beautiful maiden asleep on a bed
he was to wake the maiden instantly and carry her off
to be sure not to pay any heed to whatever resistance she might make
he walked down the passage till he found the girl on her bed
but only on condition that she was allowed first to put on her dress
this sounded so reasonable and natural that it did not enter the prince's head to refuse her request
but the maiden's hand had hardly touched the dress when the palace suddenly awoke from its sleep
things would have gone badly with him if his friends the fairies had not softened the hearts of his captors
so that they once more allowed him to leave quietly
what troubled him most was the idea of having to meet the frog who had been his benefactress
how was he ever to appear before her with this tale
he made up his mind that there was nothing else to be done
for she had worked herself into a terrible passion but the prince humbly implored her pardon
ventured to point out that it would have been very hard to refuse the young lady's reasonable request
but be careful not to return to the stable or to the bedroom they have proved too fatal to you
walk straight to the garden and enter through a portico
in the midst of which is a tree with a trunk of gold and leaves of emeralds
perched on this tree you will see the beautiful bird you have been seeking so long
you must cut the branch on which it is sitting
but i warn you solemnly that if you disobey my directions
you have nothing more to expect either of me or anyone else
he found it all just as he had been told the portico
though he noticed a splendid golden cage hanging close by
which would have been very useful for the bird to travel in
holding his breath and walking on tiptoe all the way
when instead of finding the fountain in the spot where he had left it
he saw in its place a little rustic palace built in the best taste
but i did not think you had ever seen mine
you can never guess the days and the hours i have passed lost in admiration of you
after these words they each related all the strange things that had happened
the more they talked the more they felt convinced of the truth of the images they had seen in their mirrors
let me tell you my story it is not a long one
the only thing i can say for certain is that i am called serpentine
who have taken care of me ever since i was born
wished me to be in ignorance as to my family
for the last two years i have wished for nothing better
i had a mirror here shyness and embarrassment choked her words but regaining her selfcontrol
you know that fairies insist on being obeyed without questioning
it was they who changed the little house you saw before you into the fountain for which you are now asking
they ordered me to say to the first person who came to the fountain exactly what i repeated to you
to appear to your eyes under so monstrous a form
because i could not get back my proper shape till you had become master of the beautiful bird
though i am quite ignorant as to your reason for seeking it
on this saphir explained about the state of his father's health
you know nothing of me but what you have seen in the mirror and i
in vain saphir declared that love made them equal serpentine would only reply i love you too much to allow you to marry beneath your rank
if i do not find from the fairies that my birth is worthy of you
when one of the fairies appeared in her ivory car
began fondling him as well as a bird can do
the fairy told serpentine that she was quite satisfied with her conduct
whom she presented to the lady she had brought with her
explaining that the lady was no other than his aunt aglantine
she also sent a message to the prince's attendants that they might travel slowly back to the court of king peridor
but in spite of the swiftness with which they flew through the air
they were still quite confused with the pleasure of seeing each other
he had had himself carried to a room on the roof
where his nurses thought that he would die at any moment
directly the chariot drew within sight of the castle the beautiful bird took flight
he found that the bird was no other than the queen constance
peridor was rejoiced to embrace his wife and his son once more
with the help of the fairies began to make preparations for the marriage of saphir and serpentine
who turned out to be the daughter of aglantine and diamantino
everybody lived happy and contented to the end of their lives
once upon a time there was a king who determined to take a long voyage
until they came to an island which was covered with large trees
the lions all rose up together and tried to devour them
after a long battle they managed to overcome the wild beasts
those who remained alive now went on through the forest and found on the other side of it a beautiful garden
in which all the plants of the world flourished together
there were also in the garden three springs the first flowed with silver
the men unbuckled their knapsacks and filled them with those precious things
in the middle of the garden they found a large lake
when they reached the edge of it the lake began to speak
for it is at your peril that you are come hither
but in a few minutes he will wake up and come to me to take his bath
this is what you must do if you wish to save your lives
take off your clothes and spread them on the path which leads from here to the castle
he will be so pleased with that that he will not devour you
thousands and thousands of beasts came out of the castle following their king
the serpent glided over the clothes which were spread for him
asked it who had strewed those soft things on the path
the lake answered that it had been done by people who had come to do him homage
the king commanded that the men should be brought before him
then he spoke to them with a mighty and terrible voice
every year you must bring me from among your people twelve youths and twelve maidens
then he desired one of his beasts to show the men the way out of the garden
they then left the island and went back to their own country
soon the time came round when the king of the beasts would expect the youths and maidens to be brought to him
the king therefore issued a proclamation inviting twelve youths and twelve maidens to offer themselves up to save their country and immediately many young people
in it the youths and maidens who were appointed for the king of the beasts embarked and set out for his country
when they arrived there they went at once to the lake
it was not long before the earth quaked even more terribly than the first time
the same thing happened yearly until many years had passed
now the king of this unhappy country was growing old
one day the queen was sitting at the window weeping bitterly because she was childless
knew that the crown would therefore pass to strangers after the king's death
it so happened that a mare that was running loose in the court below ate up the rind
the boy and the foal grew up together and loved each other like brothers
for i love you and wish for your good and that of the country
if you go on every year sending twelve youths and twelve maidens to the king of the beasts
mount upon my back i will take you to a woman who can direct you how to kill the sevenheaded serpent
who carried him far away to a mountain which was hollow
all round the walls of the cavern there were beds cut out of the solid rock
it was the duty of the nuns to watch the light in turns
if anyone of them let it go out the others put her to death
as soon as the king's son saw the old abbess spinning he threw himself at her feet and entreated her to tell him how he could kill the sevenheaded serpent
that it is i who sent the nun to your mother and caused you to be born
with whose help you will be able to free the world from the monster
go by a secret passage which i will show you
with this sword only it is possible to kill the serpent
because even if its blade breaks a new one will grow again for every head the monster has
thus you will be able to cut off all his seven heads
this you must also do in order to deceive the king you must slip into his bedchamber very softly
stop up all the bells which are round his bed with cotton
quickly give the monster a blow on his tail with it
if he catches sight of you he will seize you
so go on till you have cut off all his seven heads
arrived at the serpent's castle by following the secret passage which she had shown him
by carefully attending to all her directions he happily succeeded in killing the monster
as soon as the wild beasts heard of their king's death
but the youth had long since mounted his horse and was already far out of their reach
there was once upon a time a man and woman who had three finelooking sons
but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves
so the sons determined to set out into the world and to try their luck
before starting their mother gave them each a loaf of bread and her blessing
having taken a tender farewell of her and their father the three set forth on their travels
his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be
for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be
one day all the three were sitting resting under a tree
for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking
what do you say to doing our brother ferko some harm
he is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him
if we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better
my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread
then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs
the two wicked wretches seized ferko's loaf and ate it all up
when he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread
ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep
but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears
implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread
repeated what they had said the day before but when ferko continued to beg and beseech them
if you will let us put out one of your eyes and break one of your legs
then we will give you a bit of our bread
at these words poor ferko wept more bitterly than before
bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens then he could stand it no longer
he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken
when this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread
but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit
but the more ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger
the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed
so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day
he let his right eye be put out and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread
after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life
they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him
poor ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly
but no one heard him or came to his help
but when the sun was once more high in the heavens
sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs
he climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass
as he thought under the shadow of a big tree
the one was saying to the other as the weary youth lay down
is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood
replied the other many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world
those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill become as sharpsighted as the eagle
my eyes are in no want of this healing bath
they are as good as ever they were but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago
so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again
he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes
the sun sank behind the mountains gradually it became cooler on the hill
then ferko buried his face in the ground till his eyes were damp with dewdrops
in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before
lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs
then ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water
no sooner had he done so than his legs felt as sound and strong as they had been before
ferko thanked the kind fate that had led him to the hill where he had overheard the ravens conversation
he had not gone far before he met a wolf
with these words he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw
in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours
promised ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it
ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field
here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws
for its front paws had both been broken in a trap
ferko felt so sorry for the little beast that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner
after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows
but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him
which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird
ferko was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse
so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing
he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country
for he had heard that the king's daughter was as beautiful as the day
as he entered the door the first people he saw were his two brothers who had so shamefully illtreated him
they had managed to obtain places in the king's service
when they recognised ferko with his eyes and legs sound and well they were frightened to death
for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct
no sooner had ferko entered the palace than all eyes were turned on the handsome youth
for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before
so much so that they determined once more to destroy him
they went to the king and told him that ferko was a wicked magician
who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess
you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter
i condemn you to death but if you can fulfil three tasks which i shall set you to do your life shall be spared
on condition you leave the country but if you can not perform what i demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree
suggest something for him to do no matter how difficult
let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this
if he fails in the attempt let him be hung
commanded ferko to set to work on the following day
for they thought they had now got rid of ferko for ever
cursed the hour he had crossed the boundary of the king's domain
as he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round the palace
for i have been set to do a task which no one in the whole world could do
tomorrow i must build a palace more beautiful than the king's
then you may comfort yourself for before the sun goes down tomorrow night a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before
just stay here till i come again and tell you that it is finished
lay down on the grass and slept peacefully till the next morning
early on the following day the whole town was on its feet
everyone wondered how and where the stranger would build the wonderful palace
so much did she take the fate of the beautiful youth to heart
ferko spent the whole day in the meadows waiting the return of the bee
lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls
ferko went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished
their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes
a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city
made of the most exquisite flowers that ever grew in mortal garden
the doors of gorgeous tulips and narcissi with sunflowers for knockers
all round hyacinths and other sweetsmelling flowers bloomed in masses
so that the air was perfumed far and near and enchanted all who were present
this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee
who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her
the princess's eyes beamed with delight as she turned them from the wonderful building on the delighted ferko
but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy
only declared the more that ferko was nothing but a wicked magician
although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out
was very vexed that the stranger should escape with his life
with the aid no doubt of his diabolical magic but what shall we give him to do now
but it has not yet been put into barns let the knave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before tomorrow night
if as much as a stalk of corn is left let him be put to death
the princess grew white with terror when she heard these words but ferko felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time
wondering how he was to get out of the difficulty
when a little mouse started out of the grass at ferko's feet
my kind benefactor but why are you looking so sad
then ferko recognised the mouse whose front paws he had healed
alas i how can you help me in a matter that is beyond any human power
before tomorrow night all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap
if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting i must pay for it with my life
before the sun sets again you shall hear that your task is done
with these words the little creature scampered away into the fields
who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word
lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning
now there is not a single stalk of corn left in any field they are all collected in one big heap on the hill out there
then ferko went joyfully to the king and told him that all he demanded had been done
were no less astonished than they had been the first time
for in a heap higher than the king's palace lay all the grain of the country
not a single stalk of corn had been left behind in any of the fields
the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help
together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom
he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers
who kept on repeating that ferko was nothing more nor less than a wicked magician
the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him
he turned once more to the two brothers and said
but now what third task shall we set him to do
let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom on to this hill before tomorrow night
if he does this he may go free if not he shall be hung as you have said
sat down on the stump of a tree wondering what he should do next
if i can help you in any way only say the word
for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude
ferko at once recognised the wolf whose broken leg he had healed
told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life
am i to collect all the wolves of the kingdom on to that hill over there
for now he felt that his life was safe but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess
that he would never see her again if he left the country
he lay down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep
all the next day he spent wandering about the fields
toward evening the wolf came running to him in a great hurry and said
i have collected together all the wolves in the kingdom
tell him to go to the hill that he may see the wonder you have done with his own eyes
then return at once to me and get on my back
i will help you to drive all the wolves together
mounting on the wolf's back he rode to the wood close by
in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him
he drove them all before him on to the hill
where the king and his whole court and ferko's two brothers were standing
for she was shut up in her tower weeping bitterly
the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs
but the king was overcome by a sudden terror when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer
at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill
stop a moment i will give you half my kingdom if you will drive all the wolves away
then the king raised his voice again and called out
if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from
till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers
ate them and the whole court up in a moment
then ferko went straight to the palace and set the princess free
on the same day he married her and was crowned king of the country
the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes
ferko and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together
were much beloved by great and small in the land
there was once upon a time a poor boy who had neither father nor mother
in order to gain a living he looked after the sheep of a great lord
day and night he spent out in the open fields
only when it was very wet and stormy did he take refuge in a little hut on the edge of a big forest
when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks
he heard not very far from him the sound as of some one crying
he rose up and followed the direction of the noise
to his dismay and astonishment he found a giant lying at the entrance of the wood he was about to run off as fast as his legs could carry him
i will reward you handsomely if you will bind up my foot
i hurt it when i was trying to root up an oaktree
put this band round your waist and then youll be invisible
walking on in front he led him to a fountain where hundreds of giants and giantesses were assembled preparing to hold a wedding
they danced and played different games till midnight then one of the giants tore up a plant by its roots
all the giants and giantesses made themselves so thin that they disappeared into the earth through the hole made by the uprooting of the plant
the wounded giant remained behind to the last and called out
so that you too may come with us under ground
before he could have believed it possible he found himself in a big hall
then to his astonishment he saw that the hall was furnished with the tables and chairs that belonged to his master
in a few minutes the company began to eat and drink
the poor youth fell to and ate and drank lustily
when he had eaten and drunk as much as he could he thought to himself
why shouldn't i put a loaf of bread in my pocket
so he seized a loaf when no one was looking and stowed it away under his tunic
no sooner had he done so than the wounded giant limped up to him and whispered softly
in a few moments he found himself on the earth once more
took off the invisible belt which he hid carefully in his bag
thought he would cut off a piece of the loaf he had carried away from the giants wedding feast
what was his astonishment when a piece of gold fell out of his mouth and rolled at his feet
each time a piece of gold fell out of his mouth but the bread remained untouched
the herdboy was very much delighted over his stroke of good fortune
he hurried off to the nearest village to buy himself something to eat
now the lord whose sheep the herdboy looked after had a very lovely daughter
who always smiled and nodded to the youth when she walked with her father in his fields
for a long time the herdboy had made up his mind to prepare a surprise for this beautiful creature on her birthday
so when the day approached he put on his invisible belt
slipping into her room in the middle of the night
he placed the bag of gold beside her bed and returned to his sheep
so was her parents next day when they found the sack full of gold pieces
the herdboy was so pleased to think what pleasure he had given that the next night he placed another bag of gold beside the girl's bed
the girl and her parents made up their minds that it must be a good fairy who brought the gold every night
see from their hiding place who the bringer of the sack of gold really was
on the eighth night a fearful storm of wind and rain came on while the herdboy was on his way to bring the beautiful girl another bag of gold
that he had forgotten the belt which made him invisible
he didn't like the idea of going back to his hut in the wind and wet
so he just stepped as he was into the girl's room
so you were going to steal the gold that a good fairy brings every night
as you have hitherto always behaved well in my service i will not send you to prison but leave your place instantly and never let me see your face again
you may imagine how astonished he was to see his herdboy returning to him in this manner
then the youth told him of the piece of good luck that had befallen him
the two lived in peace and happiness to the end of their lives
the invisible prince once upon a time there lived a fairy who had power over the earth
which was in her opinion the noblest of all the elements
whose wisdom and prudence made amends for his being rather dull
hoped to hide them by creating him king of the seas
who was the slave of his passions and of a very uncertain temper
he was naturally his mother's favourite but this did not blind her to his weaknesses
she foresaw that some day he would suffer much pain through falling in love
so she thought the best thing she could do was to bring him up with a horror of women and
she saw this dislike only increased as he grew older
turned loose in it every animal that could be found in any of the four quarters of the globe
in the midst of this forest she built a palace which had not its equal for beauty in the whole world
then she considered that she had done enough to make any prince happy
now it is all very well to abuse the god of love
in his secret heart the prince got tired of his mother's constant talk on this subject and when one day she quitted the palace to attend to some business
he at once jumped at the chance of disobeying her
left to himself the prince soon forgot the wise counsels of his mother
he ordered some of the spirits of the air to carry him to the court of a neighbouring sovereign
where the climate is so delicious that the grass is always green and the flowers always sweet
seemed to die gently on the shore clusters of golden bushes covered the land
the king of this island had a daughter named rosalie
who was more lovely than any girl in the whole world
for in one single moment the plans of years are often upset
he instantly began to think how best to make himself happy
the shortest way that occurred to him was to have rosalie carried off by his attendant spirits
it is easy to imagine the feelings of the king when he found that his daughter had vanished
his only comfort was to talk over it with a young and unknown prince
he did not know what a deep interest the stranger had in rosalie
he said to the unhappy father and if you will promise me your daughter in marriage
did i not see her caught up into the air
in spite of cries which would have softened the heart of any one but the barbarian who has robbed me of her
the unfortunate girl is pining away in some unknown land
although the stranger's name and rank were unknown to rosalie's father
he was really the son of the king of the golden isle
which had for capital a city that extended from one sea to another
above them was a rampart of orange and lemon trees
for whom a life of adventure had been foretold at his birth
this so frightened his father and mother that in order to comfort them a fairy
produced a little pebble which she told them to keep for the prince till he grew up
as by putting it in his mouth he would become invisible
for if he did the stone would lose all its virtue
in this way the good fairy hoped that the prince would be protected against all dangers
under pretence of visiting some small islands that belonged to his father
but a frightful storm drove his ship on to unknown shores
where most of his followers were put to death by the savages
the prince himself only managed to escape by making use of his magic pebble
by this means he passed through the midst of them unseen
the first land he sighted was the island of roses
he went at once to the court of the king
he had already spent several months in this condition when the prince of the air whirled her away
to the grief and despair of every man on the island
he passed both days and nights in bemoaning his loss
he cried shall i never see my lovely princess again
i will seek the whole world through till i find her
he travelled many weary days without hearing a single word of the lost princess
he suddenly perceived a magnificent palace standing at the end of a pine avenue
his heart bounded to think that he might be gazing on rosalie's prison
but the prince scarcely raised his eyes to all these wonders
he thought only of the princess and where he should find her
but in vain he opened every door and searched in every corner he neither saw rosalie nor anyone else
at last there was no place left for him to search but a little wood
which contained in the centre a sort of hall built entirely of orangetrees
three of these were empty except for statues and wonderful things
but in the fourth the invisible prince caught sight of rosalie
somewhat lessened by seeing that the prince of the air was kneeling at her feet
but it was in vain that he implored her to listen she only shook her head
was all she would say you snatched me from my father whom i loved
all the splendour in the world can never console me
i can never feel anything towards you but hate and contempt
with these words she turned away and entered her own apartments
but fearing to be discovered by the princess in the presence of others
he made up his mind to wait quietly till dark and employed the long hours in writing a poem to the princess
he thought of nothing but how best to deliver rosalie
he resolved to take advantage of a visit which the prince of the air paid every year to his mother and brothers in order to strike the blow
as she did not know that it was guided by an invisible hand she was very much astonished
the moment that the pen had ceased to move she instantly went over to the table
loved her with all his heart and that he would never rest until he had delivered her from the hands of the man she hated
of the arrival of a young stranger in her father's palace
whose looks had so charmed her that since that day she had thought of no one else
at these words the prince could contain himself no longer
when they had got over the first rapture of meeting they began to make plans to escape from the power of the prince of the air
for the magic stone would only serve for one person at a time
in order to save rosalie the prince of the golden isle would have to expose himself to the fury of his enemy
she said since you are here this island no longer feels a prison
when she is found implore the gift of another stone with similar powers
there will be no further difficulty in the way of escape
the prince of the air returned a few days later from his mother's palace
that when at last he reached home the fairy had already left
there was nothing for it but to wait till the fairy's next visit
he had almost made up his mind to return to the place of her captivity
as he was strolling along an alley in the woods
as our hero had the magic stone in his mouth they imagined themselves alone
are you always going to allow yourself to be tormented by a passion which can never end happily
in your whole kingdom can you find nothing else to satisfy you
having a mother who is queen over all the four elements
if i can not win the love of the princess argentine
i have never ceased to think of her night and day
i am quite convinced that she will never care for me
you know that i have in my palace the cabinets of the years
it was here that i fled after i had gazed on the princess argentine
but instead of love i only saw scorn and contempt
now the prince of the golden isle was enchanted with this conversation
by means of her influence over the prince of the gnomes
who at once presented him with a magic pebble like his own
he lost no time in setting out to deliver rosalie
travelled so fast that he soon arrived at the forest
but though he found the palace he did not find rosalie
at last he remembered the conversation of the two princes about the cabinets of the years
that if he could manage to reach the oak tree
he would be certain to discover what had become of rosalie
he soon found out the secret of the passage and entered the cabinet of the present
where he saw reflected in the mirrors the unfortunate rosalie sitting on the floor weeping bitterly
he resolved to seek the whole world through till he came to the right place
but his bad luck followed him even on the sea
he had scarcely lost sight of the land when a violent storm arose
the prince was fortunate enough to be able to lay hold of a floating spar
mingled with the sweetest songs which had ever charmed him
he advanced cautiously till he saw two huge dragons guarding the gate of a wood
their bodies were covered with glittering scales their curly tails extended far over the land flames darted from their mouths and noses
their eyes would have made the bravest shudder but as the prince was invisible and they did not see him
wandered about for a long time without meeting anyone in fact
the only sight he saw was a circle of human hands
the farther he advanced in the labyrinth the more curious he became
till he was stopped by two corpses lying in the midst of a cypress alley
each with a scarlet cord round his neck and a bracelet on his arm on which were engraved their own names
the invisible prince recognised these dead men as kings of two large islands near his own home
but the names of the princesses were unknown to him
at once proceeded to bury them but no sooner had he laid them in their graves
than their hands started up through the earth and remained sticking up like those of their fellows
when suddenly at the turn of the walk he perceived a tall man whose face was the picture of misery
holding in his hands a silken cord of the exact colour of those round the necks of the dead men
a few steps further this man came up with another as miserable to the full as he himself they silently embraced
then without a word passed the cords round their throats
in vain the prince rushed to their assistance and strove to undo the cord
he could not loosen it so he buried them like the others and continued his path
or he himself might become the victim of some enchantment and he was thankful to slip past the dragons
but he could not forget the terrible things he had seen
he drew near thinking that he might get some explanation of what puzzled him
i feel that i shall soon have to seek the fairy despair
she carries off the lovers who have been cast away by their mistresses
she places them in a labyrinth where they are condemned to walk for ever
with a bracelet on their arms and a cord round their necks
then the cord is pulled and they lie where they fall
it would be sweeter than life if i had lost your love
the sight of all these happy lovers only made the prince grieve the more
he wandered along the seashore spending his days but one day he was sitting on a rock bewailing his fate
when all in a moment the sea appeared to raise itself nearly to the skies
as he looked a woman rose from the depths of the sea
the cries she uttered softened the heart of the prince he took the stone from his mouth
but hardly had he come within reach of the enemy
than the giant touched him with a ring that he held in his hand
then he sent some tritons to bind chains about the prince of the golden isle
he too felt himself borne to the depths of the ocean
now the giant whom the invisible had so rashly attacked was the lord of the sea
he had touched the youth with a magic ring which enabled a mortal to live under water
he was carried through the homes of strange monsters and past immense seaweed forests
on the tallest of the rocks sat the giant as on a throne
add to the number of those whom it is my pleasure to torture
at these words the unhappy prince found himself tied to a rock but he was not alone in his misfortunes
in order to add to the list of his prisoners
it was impossible for the prince of the golden isle to make use of his magic stone
but at last the time came when the giant took it into his head to amuse himself by arranging fights between some of his captives
the astonishment of the giant at the sudden disappearance of the prince may well be imagined
where he met nothing but fearful monsters he climbed rock after rock
till at length he arrived at the edge of the sea
at the foot of a mountain that he remembered to have seen in the cabinet of the present
he made his way to the top of the mountain which pierced the clouds
in the middle of a long gallery he discovered a crystal room
at this sight the prince became more puzzled than ever
for he did not know how he was to warn rosalie of his return
yet it broke his heart to see her weeping from dawn till dark
she was surprised to see that the crystal which served for a wall had grown cloudy
wherever she moved the brightness of the crystal always became clouded
this was enough to cause the princess to suspect that her lover had returned
in order to set the prince of the air's mind at rest she began by being very gracious to him
so that when she begged that her captivity might be a little lightened she should not be refused
at first the only favour she asked was to be allowed to walk for one hour every day up and down the long gallery
the invisible prince speedily took the opportunity of handing her the stone
no words can paint the fury of her captor at her disappearance
he ordered the spirits of the air to fly through all space
a door of the gallery which led through a terrace into the gardens
when a furious monster dashed itself by accident against rosalie and the invisible prince
no one can speak as long as he is invisible
at the slightest sound they would be recognised so all they could do was to feel about in the hope that their hands might once more meet
as she walked she wrote on the trees if ever the prince
that i sit daily on the edge of this fountain
throwing off his invisibility cried to his spirits to drag her into the lowest pit
it was at this moment that the invisible prince appeared
at the sight of the prince of the genii mounting into the air
he felt so overwhelmed by despair that he thought for an instant of putting an end to his life
i fancied i had come to an end of my troubles
never can i discover the place where this monster will hide rosalie
when the thought that by means of the cabinets of the years he might find out where the princess was imprisoned
after some hours he arrived at the gate of a temple
as the prince had not the smallest idea where this fountain was to be found
it might be thought that he was not much nearer rosalie than before
though every step that i take may perhaps lead me further from her
i am still thankful to know that she is alive somewhere
on leaving the temple the invisible prince saw six paths lying before him
they turned out to be the prince gnome and his friend
the sudden desire to get some news of his sister
caused the invisible prince to follow them and to listen to their conversation
do you think that i would not break my chains if i could
i know that the princess argentine will never love me
i have the horror of feeling that she probably loves another
so i have resolved to put myself out of my pain by means of the golden fountain
a single drop of its water falling on the sand around will trace the name of my rival in her heart
it may be imagined that after listening to these words the invisible prince followed prince gnome like his shadow
after walking some time they arrived at the golden fountain
dipping his finger in the water let fall a drop on the sand
that prince gnome sank fainting into the arms of his friend
meanwhile the invisible prince was turning over in his mind how he could best deliver rosalie
he had the power to live in the water as well as on land
he perceived in one corner a door leading into the mountain
at the foot of the mountain was a high rock on which was fixed an iron ring with a cord attached
the prince promptly guessed that the cord was used to chain the princess
in a moment he felt the princess's hand in his
for she had always kept her magic pebble in her mouth
in spite of the prayers and entreaties of the prince of the air to make herself visible
so hand in hand the invisible prince and rosalie crossed the mountain but as the princess had no power of living under water
trembling at the frightful tempest the prince of the air had raised in his fury
the storm had already lasted many days when tremendous heat began to make itself felt
burning up the forests and even the fields of corn
it took them a long time still to reach the golden isle
we may be quite sure they never wanted to leave it any more
once upon a time there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful but the youngest
about half a mile from the palace in which they lived there stood a castle
but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers
in this garden the youngest princess used often to walk
one day when she was pacing to and fro under the lime trees
a black crow hopped out of a rosebush in front of her
when the crow saw this it turned to her and said i am not really a black crow
who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery
but you would have to say goodbye to all your own people and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle
in which there is a golden bed there you will have to live all by yourself
don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out
for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled
the goodnatured princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle
but though she shut her eyes tight sleep would not come
at midnight she heard to her great horror some one coming along the passage
in a minute her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room
they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it
they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay
at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all round the room with joy
went to pay her youngest sister a visit in the ruined castle
she implored her so urgently to let her spend the night with her in the golden bed
from this time on the youngest princess insisted always on keeping watch alone
had she not been so brave but every day the crow came and thanked her for her endurance
assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been
when one day the crow came to the princess and said in another year i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present
you must go out into the world and take service as a maidservant
for a whole year she served as a maid but in spite of her youth and beauty she was very badly treated
she heard a rustling beside her and a cry of joy
then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her who knelt down at her feet and kissed the little weary white hands
when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow
so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much
it was difficult to believe that it was the same
for it had all been rebuilt and done up again
how six men travelled through the wide world there was once upon a time a man who understood all sorts of arts he served in the war
bore himself bravely and well but when the war was over
set out on his travels with three farthings of his pay in his pocket
he said that does not please me only let me find the right people
the king shall yet give me all the treasures of his kingdom
there he saw a man standing who had uprooted six trees as if they were straws
he answered but first of all i will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother
he took one of the trees and wound it round the other five
raised the bundle on his shoulders and bore it off
we two ought to be able to travel through the wide world
when they had gone a little way they came upon a hunter
two miles from this place sits a fly on a branch of an oak i want to shoot out its left eye
said the man if we three are together we shall easily travel through the wide world
they came to seven windmills whose sails were going round quite fast
i don't know what is turning those windmills there is not the slightest breeze blowing
when they had gone two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree
holding one of his nostrils and blowing out of the other
two miles from this place are standing seven windmills see
said the man if we four are together we shall easily travel through the wide world
after a time they saw a man who was standing on one leg
answered he and so that i shall not go too quickly
i have unstrapped one leg when i run with two legs
said the master to him don't hang your hat over one ear you look like a madman
for if i were to put my hat on straight
there would come such a frost that the very birds in the sky would freeze and fall dead on the earth
now the six came to a town in which the king had proclaimed that whoever should run with his daughter in a race
this was reported to the man who declared he would compete
your head and his must be guaranteed for the winner
it was arranged that whoever should first bring water out of a stream a long way off
they began to run at the same time but in a moment
when the king's daughter was only just a little way off
a great drowsiness came over him he put down his pitcher
put a horse's skull which was lying on the ground
so that he should not be too comfortable and might soon wake up
if by good luck the hunter had not been standing on the castle tower and had seen everything with his sharp eyes
that he shot away the horse's skull from under the runner's head
saw that his pitcher was empty and the king's daughter far ahead
i have only just exercised my legs that was nothing of a run
they consulted together how they could destroy both him and his companions
he led them into a room which had a floor of iron the doors were also of iron
in the room was a table spread with delicious food
as soon as they were inside he had the doors shut and bolted
ordered him to keep up a large fire under the room until the iron was redhot
the six sitting round the table felt it grow very warm
they thought this was because of their good fare but when the heat became still greater and they wanted to go out
then they knew that the king meant them harm and was trying to suffocate them
i will make a frost come which shall make the fire ashamed and die out
at once there came such a frost that all the heat disappeared and the food on the dishes began to freeze
the king thought they must be quite dead from the heat
he had the doors opened and went in himself to see
saying they were glad they could come out to warm themselves
for the great cold in the room had frozen all the food hard in the dishes
asked him why he had not done what he was told
then the king saw a huge fire burning under the iron room
understood that he could do no harm to the six in this way
the king now began again to think how he could free himself from his unwelcome guests
then he called all the tailors in the kingdom together
made them sit down for fourteen days sewing at a sack
he made the strong man who had uprooted the trees take the sack on his shoulder and go with him to the king
carrying that bale of linen as large as a house on his shoulder
thought what a lot of gold he will make away with
which sixteen of the strongest men had to carry but the strong man seized it with one hand
then the king had to send again and again to fetch his treasures
so seven thousand waggons of the gold of the whole kingdom were driven up these the strong man shoved into the sack
when everything was put in and there was not yet enough
i will make an end of this it is easy to fasten a sack when it is not full
then he threw it on his back and went with his companions
when the king saw how a single man was carrying away the wealth of the whole country he was very angry
lay down the sack of gold or you shall be cut down
he held one nostril and blew with the other at the two regiments they were separated and blown away in the blue sky over the mountains
say that if he sends any more cavalry i will blow them all into the air
whose power lay not only in the vast extent of his dominions
but also in the magic secrets of which he was master
after spending the greater part of his early youth in pleasure
he met a princess of such remarkable beauty that he at once asked her hand in marriage
as soon as the queen thought him strong enough for a journey she set out with him secretly to visit her fairy godmother
because the fairy had warned the queen that the king was a magician and as from time immemorial there had been a standing feud between the fairies and the wizards
who took the deepest interest in all the queen's concerns
endowed him with the power of pleasing everybody from his cradle
as well as with a wonderful ease in learning everything which could help to make him a perfectly accomplished prince
whose last words were to advise him never to undertake anything of importance without consulting the fairy under whose protection she had placed him
the prince's grief at the death of his mother was great
but it was nothing compared to that of the king
who was quite inconsolable for the loss of his dear wife
the sight of all the familiar faces and things about him only served to remind him of his loss
by means of his magic art was able to visit every country he came to see under different shapes
returning every few weeks to the place where he had left a few followers
having travelled from land to land in this fashion without finding anything to rivet his attention
it occurred to him to take the form of an eagle
in this shape he flew across many countries and arrived at length in a new and lovely spot
where the air seemed filled with the scent of jessamine and orange flowers with which the ground was thickly planted
perceived some large and beautiful gardens filled with the rarest flowers
with fountains throwing up their clear waters into the air in a hundred different shapes
on it floated richly ornamented barges and gondolas filled with people dressed in the most elegant manner and covered with jewels
in one of these barges sat the queen of that country with her only daughter
no more exquisitely lovely mortal was ever seen than this princess
it needed all an eagle's strength of sight to prevent the king being hopelessly dazzled
he perched on the top of a large orange tree
whence he was able to survey the scene and to gaze at pleasure on the princess's charms
an eagle with a king's heart in his breast is apt to be bold
accordingly he instantly made up his mind to carry off the lovely damsel
feeling sure that having once seen her he could not live without her
he waited till he saw her in the act of stepping ashore
he carried her off before her equerry in attendance had advanced to offer her his hand
uttered the most heartbreaking shrieks and cries but her captor
continued to fly through the air too fast to allow of his saying anything to comfort her
told her that he was about to carry her to a great kingdom over which he ruled
for some time the princess remained speechless but recovering herself a little
my only wish is to make you the happiest person in the world
restore to me the liberty you have deprived me of
otherwise i can only look on you as my worst enemy
the king retorted that her opposition filled him with despair
but that he hoped to carry her to a place where all around would respect her
in spite of all her cries he rapidly bore her off to the neighbourhood of his capital
as he did so she saw a magnificent palace spring up at her feet
in the interior the rooms were handsome and furnished in the best possible taste
was pleased at finding herself surrounded by a number of pretty girls
whilst a brilliantlycoloured parrot said the most agreeable things in the world
on arriving at this palace the king had resumed his own form
he might well have pleased any other than this princess
who had been so prejudiced against him by his violence that she could only regard him with feelings of hatred
he took the precaution of surrounding the palace with a dense cloud
the prince and all the courtiers were delighted to see their beloved king again
but they had to submit themselves to more frequent absences than ever on his part
he made business a pretext for shutting himself up in his study
but it was really in order to spend the time with the princess
not being able to imagine what could be the cause of so much obstinacy the king began to fear
she might have heard of the charms of the prince his son
he resolved to remove the cause of his fears by sending the prince on his travels escorted by a magnificent retinue
arrived at the one where the lost princess was still deeply mourned
one day when the prince was visiting the queen in her own apartments he was much struck by a most beautiful portrait
told him it was all that was left her of her beloved daughter
vowed that he would search the world for the princess
take no rest till he had found and restored her to her mother's arms
far more attracted by the thoughts of possessing the princess than her promised dower
set forth in his quest after taking leave of the king and queen
the latter giving him a miniature of her daughter which she was in the habit of wearing
his first act was to seek the fairy under whose protection he had been placed
he implored her to give him all the assistance of her art and counsel in this important matter
after due consideration she informed the prince that the object of his search was not far distant
but that it was too difficult for him to attempt to enter the enchanted palace where she was
as the king his father had surrounded it with a thick cloud
that the only expedient she could think of would be to gain possession of the princess's parrot
as it often flew about to some distance in the neighbourhood
the fairy went out in hopes of seeing the parrot
but was so dazzled at first by the princess's beauty
he began to say a thousand agreeable things which charmed the princess
the parrot noticed with joy how much he was disliked
the parrot flew after her and overheard her lamentations at the continued persecutions of the king
the parrot said so many clever and tender things to comfort her that she began to doubt whether this could indeed be her own parrot
i have a most important secret to confide to you
i beg you not to be alarmed by what i am about to say
i am here on behalf of the queen your mother
with the object of delivering your highness to prove which
so saying he drew forth the miniature from under his wing
but after what she had seen and heard it was impossible not to indulge in hope
for she had recognised the likeness of herself which her mother always wore
he implored the princess to allow him to resume his natural shape
she beheld before her a prince of such surpassing beauty that it was impossible not to hope that she might owe her liberty to so charming a person
to which she harnessed two powerful eagles then placing the cage
she charged the bird to conduct it to the window of the princess's dressingroom
as they rose through the air the princess remarked a figure mounted on an eagle's back flying in front of the chariot
telling her it was the good fairy to whom she owed so much
who was now conducting her in safety to her mother
that same morning the king woke suddenly from a troubled sleep
he had dreamt that the princess was being carried off from him
when he failed to find her he flew into a terrible rage
by which means he discovered that it was his son who had deprived him of this precious treasure
he set out at full speed but he started too late
was further delayed by a strong wind which the fairy raised behind the young couple so as to baffle any pursuit
you may imagine the rapture with which the queen received the daughter she had given up for lost
as well as the amiable prince who had rescued her
warned the queen that the wizard king would shortly arrive
that nothing could preserve the prince and princess from his rage and magic unless they were actually married
his despair at being so late bewildered him so entirely that he appeared in his natural form and attempted to sprinkle some black liquid over the bride and bridegroom
but the fairy stretched out her wand and the liquid dropped on the magician himself
deeply offended at the cruel revenge which had been attempted
ordered him to be removed and locked up in prison
now as magicians lose all their power as soon as they are in prison
the king felt himself much embarrassed at being thus at the mercy of those he had so greatly offended
no sooner was this done than the wizard king was seen in the air under the form of some unknown bird
exclaiming as he flew off that he would never forgive either his son or the fairy the cruel wrong they had done him
everyone entreated the fairy to settle in the kingdom where she now was
where she enjoyed the sight of the perfect happiness she had helped to bestow on the entire royal family
there was once upon a time a miller who was very well off
had as much money and as many goods as he knew what to do with
the miller all of a sudden became so poor that at last he could hardly call the mill in which he sat his own
he wandered about all day full of despair and misery
when he lay down at night he could get no rest
one morning he rose up before dawn and went outside
for he thought his heart would be lighter in the open air
as he wandered up and down on the banks of the millpond he heard a rustling in the water
when he looked near he saw a white woman rising up from the waves
he realised at once that this could be none other than the nixy of the millpond
in his terror he didn't know if he should fly away or remain where he was
he plucked up heart and told her how rich and prosperous he had been all his life up till now
when he didn't know what he was to do for want and misery
promised that she would make him richer and more prosperous than he had ever been in his life before
if he would give her in return the youngest thing in his house
the miller thought she must mean one of his puppies or kittens
on the threshold he was greeted by a servant with the news that his wife had just given birth to a boy
went in to his wife with a heavy heart to tell her and his relations of the fatal bargain he had just struck with the nixy
i would gladly give up all the good fortune she promised me
but no one could think of any advice to give him
beyond taking care that the child never went near the millpond
in a few years he was richer than he had ever been before
but all the same he did not enjoy his good fortune
for he could not forget his compact with the nixy
he knew that sooner or later she would demand his fulfilment of it
the lord of the land took him into his service
for he was as smart and bold a hunter as you would wish to see
in a short time he married a pretty young wife
one day when he was out hunting a hare sprang up at his feet
ran for some way in front of him in the open field
which from childhood up he had been taught to avoid
went to the water to wash the blood off his hands
he had hardly dipped them in the pond when the nixy rose up in the water
seizing him in her wet arms she dragged him down with her under the waves
when the hunter did not come home in the evening his wife grew very anxious
when his game bag was found close to the millpond she guessed at once what had befallen him
roamed round and round the pond calling on her husband without ceasing
she fell asleep and dreamt that she was wandering along a flowery meadow
when she came to a hut where she found an old witch
when she awoke next morning she determined to set out and find the witch so she wandered on for many a day
at last she reached the flowery meadow and found the hut where the old witch lived
the poor wife told her all that had happened and how she had been told in a dream of the witch's power to help her
the witch counselled her to go to the pond the first time there was a full moon
time dragged heavily till the time of the full moon
as soon as it rose the young wife went to the pond
placed the comb on the bank then she watched the water impatiently
a big wave rose suddenly and swept the comb off the bank
a minute after the head of her husband rose from the pond and gazed sadly at her
the head sank back into the water without having said a word
the hunter's wife was not a bit better off than she had been before
so next morning she went again to the flowery meadow and sought the witch in her hut
the old woman counselled her to go to the millpond the next full moon and play upon a golden flute
as soon as the next moon was full the hunter's wife went to the millpond
soon the head of the hunter appeared and rose up higher and higher till he was half out of the water
then he gazed sadly at his wife and stretched out his arms towards her
but another rushing wave arose and dragged him under once more
who had stood on the bank full of joy and hope
sank into despair when she saw her husband snatched away again before her eyes
but for her comfort she dreamt the same dream a third time
betook herself once more to the old witch's hut in the flowery meadow
this time the old woman told her to go the next full moon to the millpond
the first night the moon was full she sat and spun with a golden spinningwheel
in a few minutes a rushing sound was heard in the waters
immediately the head of the hunter rose up from the pond
till at length he stepped on to the bank and fell on his wife's neck
in her despair the young wife called on the old witch to help her
in a moment the hunter was turned into a frog and his wife into a toad
when the flood was over they both resumed their own shapes again
but the hunter and the hunter's wife found themselves each in a strange country
so they herded their sheep for many years in solitude and sadness
now it happened once that the shepherd came to the country where the shepherdess lived
he saw that the pasture was rich and suitable for his flocks
but they did not recognise each other in the least
but one evening when the moon was full they sat together watching their flocks
left her no peace till she told him all her story
once upon a time there was a glass mountain at the top of which stood a castle made of pure gold
in front of the castle there grew an appletree on which there were golden apples
anyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castle
there in a silver room sat an enchanted princess of surpassing fairness and beauty
for the cellars of the castle were full of precious stones
great chests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the rooms
many knights had come from afar to try their luck
but it was in vain they attempted to climb the mountain
in spite of having their horses shod with sharp nails
then they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep slippery hill
the beautiful princess sat at her window and watched the bold knights trying to reach her on their splendid horses
they flocked from the four quarters of the globe to attempt the work of rescuing her
for seven years the princess had sat now and waited for some one to scale the glass mountain
a heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain
many dying men lay groaning there unable to go any farther with their wounded limbs
the whole neighbourhood had the appearance of a vast churchyard
in three more days the seven years would be at an end
when a knight in golden armour and mounted on a spirited steed was seen making his way towards the fatal hill
sticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain
then he calmly turned his horse's head and came down again without a slip or stumble
the following day he started in the same way the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earth
in another moment he would have reached the appletree but of a sudden a huge eagle rose up and spread its mighty wings
hitting as it did so the knight's horse in the eye
its hind feet slipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain side
nothing was left of either of them except their bones
which rattled in the battered golden armour like dry peas in a pod
now there was only one more day before the close of the seven years
then there arrived on the scene a mere schoolboy a merry
he saw how many knights had broken their necks in vain
but undaunted he approached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascent
for long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful princess who sat in the golden castle at the top of the glass mountain
but first he went to the forest and caught a lynx
he fastened them on to his own hands and feet
armed with these weapons he boldly started up the glass mountain
he could hardly draw breath he was so worn out
but in vain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him
but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as a drop of dew moistened his dry lips
he strained his eyes to see if he could behold the top of the mountain
this had been the end of all the other brave men who like himself had attempted the ascent
the poor boy still clung on as if glued to the glass by his bloodstained hands
then all of a sudden he fell into a deep sleep
he had stuck his sharp claws so firmly into the glass that he was quite safe not to fall
now the golden appletree was guarded by the eagle which had overthrown the golden knight and his horse
every night it flew round the glass mountain keeping a careful lookout
no sooner had the moon emerged from the clouds than the bird rose up from the appletree
the eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth
the creature in terror lifted him high up into the air and began to circle round the tower of the castle
which by the pale rays of the moon looked like a dim lamp and he saw the high windows
round one of them a balcony in which the beautiful princess sat lost in sad thoughts
then the boy saw that he was close to the appletree
the bird rose up in the air in its agony and vanished into the clouds
the youth fell on to the broad branches of the appletree
then he drew out the claws of the eagle's feet that had remained in his flesh
put the peel of one of the golden apples on the wound
he pulled several of the beautiful apples and put them in his pocket then he entered the castle
but as soon as he threw an apple at it
the youth perceived a courtyard full of flowers and beautiful trees
on a balcony sat the lovely enchanted princess with her retinue
she ran towards him and greeted him as her husband and master
who had been the guardian of the princess and of the castle
could have carried on his wings the enormous treasure down to the world
but as the eagle had lost its feet it died
its body was found in a wood on the glass mountain
one day when the youth was strolling about in the palace garden with the princess
he looked down over the edge of the glass mountain and saw to his astonishment a great number of people gathered there
the swallow who acted as messenger in the golden castle flew past
who sped off like lightning and soon returned saying the blood of the eagle has restored all the people below to life
all those who have perished on this mountain are awakening up today
the whole population are gazing on this unheardof wonder with joy and amazement
or the green monkey many years ago there lived a king
the king her husband was so overwhelmed with grief at her loss that his only comfort was in the sight of his heir
when the time for the young prince's christening came the king chose as godmother a neighbouring princess
so celebrated for her wisdom and goodness that she was commonly called the good queen
but by no means of so amiable a disposition as the first queen
the queen was devoured with rage at the thought that prince alphege came between her son and the throne
she took care however to conceal her jealous feelings from the king
so she sent a trusty servant to her old and faithful friend the fairy of the mountain
to beg her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson
much as she desired to be agreeable to the queen in every way
it was impossible for her to attempt anything against the young prince
who was under the protection of some greater power than her own
the good queen on her side watched carefully over her godson
but she was well informed of all that went on and knew all about the queen's wicked designs
she therefore sent the prince a large and splendid ruby
with injunctions to wear it night and day as it would protect him from all attacks
but added that the talisman only retained its power as long as the prince remained within his father's dominions
the wicked queen knowing this made every attempt to get the prince out of the country
till one day accident did what she was unable to accomplish
the king had an only sister who was deeply attached to him
who was married to the sovereign of a distant country
she had always kept up a close correspondence with her brother
the accounts she heard of prince alphege made her long to become acquainted with so charming a nephew
she entreated the king to allow the prince to visit her
in his infancy he had been placed in the charge of one of the great ladies of the court
acted first as his head nurse and then as his governess
when he outgrew her care her husband was appointed as his tutor and governor
so that he had never been separated from this excellent couple
who loved him as tenderly as they did their only daughter zayda
when the prince set forth on his travels it was but natural that this devoted couple should accompany him
accordingly he started with them and attended by a numerous retinue
for some time he travelled through his father's dominions and all went well but soon after passing the frontier they had to cross a desert plain under a burning sun
they were glad to take shelter under a group of trees near
luckily a tiny stream ran close by and some water was soon procured
but no sooner had he tasted it than he sprang from his carriage and disappeared in a moment
as they were hunting and shouting through the trees a black monkey suddenly appeared on a point of rock and said poor sorrowing people
return to your own country and know that he will not be restored to you till you have for some time failed to recognise him
leaving the courtiers sadly perplexed but as all their efforts to find the prince were useless they had no choice but to go home
which so greatly distressed the king that he fell ill and died not long after
was delighted to see the crown on her son's head and to have the power in her own hands
it was commonly believed that she had made away with prince alphege
had the king her son not been deservedly beloved a revolution would certainly have arisen
who had lost her husband soon after the king's death
both continued to mourn the loss of their dear prince
after a long morning's chase he stopped to rest near a brook in the shade of a little wood
whilst at luncheon he suddenly spied a little monkey of the brightest green sitting on a tree and gazing so tenderly at him that he felt quite moved
the monkey took it very daintily and finally came to the table
the whole court soon talked of nothing but the pretty green monkey
as prince alphege's governess and her daughter were alone together
his manners were so gentle and caressing that zayda and her mother soon got over the first fright he had given them
he had spent some time with them and quite won their hearts by his insinuating ways
when the king discovered where he was and sent to fetch him back
that the two ladies begged the king to leave him a little longer with them
the little monkey kept gazing at zayda with such sad and loving eyes that she and her mother could not think what to make of it
they were still more surprised when they saw big tears rolling down his cheeks
next day both mother and daughter were sitting in a jessamine bower in the garden
they began to talk of the green monkey and his strange ways
i can not get the thought out of my mind that the green monkey is no other than our beloved prince alphege
but i can not get it out of my heart
the following night the elder lady dreamt that she saw the good queen
go into your garden and lift up the little marble slab at the foot of the great myrtle tree
you will find beneath it a crystal vase filled with a bright green liquid
take it with you and place the thing which is at present most in your thoughts into a bath filled with roses and rub it well with the green liquid
lost no time in rising and hurrying to the garden
where she found all as the good queen had described
then she hastened to rouse her daughter and together they prepared the bath
for they would not let their women know what they were about
when all was ready they put the monkey into a large jasper bath
where the mother rubbed him all over with the green liquid
after a time the ladies begged the prince to relate his adventures
he told them of all his sufferings in the desert when he was first transformed
his only comfort had been in visits from the good queen
who had at length put him in the way of meeting his brother
but at length zayda's mother began to think of the best means for placing the prince on the throne
she had felt sure from the first that her son's pet monkey was no other than prince alphege
her suspicions were confirmed by the fairy of the mountain
that some illdisposed people have raised up an impostor in the hopes of dethroning you
assured the queen that he would soon punish the conspirators
thought it hardly probable that a quiet widow and a young girl would think of attempting anything of the nature of a revolution
to find out the truth for himself so one night
he set out for the palace where the two ladies lived
the two ladies were at the moment deep in conversation with prince alphege
hearing a knocking so late at night begged him to keep out of sight for a time
what was their surprise when the door was opened to see the king and his suite
he spoke with such grace and dignity that everyone gazed at him with mute surprise
recovering from his astonishment at recognising the brother who had been lost some years before
take the throne to which i have no longer a right
where in the presence of the entire court he received the crown from his brother's hand
he showed the ruby which the good queen had given him in his childhood
king alphege lost no time in marrying his dear and lovely zayda
his joy was complete when the good queen appeared at his wedding
she assured him that the fairy of the mountain had henceforth lost all power over him
fairerthanafairy once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage
at length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as fairerthanafairy
it never occurred to the goodnatured monarch that such a name was certain to call down the hatred and jealousy of the fairies in a body on the child
no sooner had they heard of this presumptuous name than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it
or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men
the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge
this fairy was named lagree she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left
even these poor remains she had to keep all night in a strengthening liquid
she was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or illnatured tricks of the whole body of fairies
nearly died of fear on finding herself in the power of this hideous creature
when after an hour's journey underground she found herself in a splendid palace with lovely gardens
was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her
the old fairy led her to a pretty room which she said should be hers
at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate
she then gave two glass bottles into the princess's charge
having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience
leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace and grounds and a good deal relieved at having only two apparently easy tasks set her
during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life
by degrees forgot all about the court of the king her father
she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow
she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays
its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered
led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming but this had to be a mere matter of fancy
had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years that she had imprisoned him in the palace
where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time
he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairerthanafairy
could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions
the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow
it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves
fairerthanafairy lost no moment in which she could meet her lover
their conversation became so absorbing and time passed so quickly that the princess forgot to attend to the fire
seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner
she ordered fairerthanafairy to start next day at dawn to ask locrinos for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out
now this locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across
especially enjoyed a chance of catching and eating any young girls
without having been able to take leave of her lover she set off to go to locrinos as to certain death
as she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by
who was much struck by the princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners
still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble
then she sent her away without doing her any harm
lagree was as much surprised as displeased at the happy result of this expedition
fairerthana fairy waited anxiously for an opportunity of meeting prince rainbow and telling him her adventures
that he had already been told all about them by a fairy who protected him
the dread of fresh dangers to his beloved princess made him devise some more convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain
every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her windowsill
as soon as the sun's rays fell on the water the rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain
for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together
one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe
he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot
but he had no idea where he was to go
it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes
spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight
no other water was at hand except that in the two bottles
it was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated
she did not hesitate to break the bottle and pour their contents into the basin
their farewells were full of tenderness the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations
promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear fairerthanafairy from her captivity
implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free
declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him
they were not allowed much time for their adieus the rainbow vanished
when lagree became aware of her prisoner's flight she was furious
had lain down to rest in a cave which the stone had formed itself into to shelter her
before she had recovered from the pain and rage this caused her
immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her
springing from one of the boughs of the arbour she flew at lagree's face and tore out her only eye
one might have thought that all would now be well
but no sooner had lagree been put to fight than our heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst
it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far as a pretty little green and white house
here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house
after a long night's rest in a delightful bed told her that after many troubles she should finally attain her desire
as the green and white lady took leave of the princess she gave her a nut
desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need
after a long and tiring journey fairerthanafairy was once more received in a house
by a lady exactly like the one she had quitted
here again she received a present with the same injunctions
but instead of a nut this lady gave her a golden pomegranate
after many troubles and hardships she again found rest and shelter in a third house exactly similar to the two others
all so alike in mind and person that they wished their houses and garments to be equally alike
they were as gentle and benevolent as lagree had been cruel and spiteful
she accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smellingbottle
with strict orders only to open it in case of urgent need
before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle suspended by strong silver chains to four of the largest trees
it was so perfectly hung that a gentle breeze rocked it sufficiently to send you pleasantly to sleep
but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows
she had no doubt that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her
out came a diminutive hall porter at whose belt hung a tiny chain
at the end of which was a golden key half as long as the smallest pin you ever saw
opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in
she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle
which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling
draped with curtains of all the colours of the rainbow
suspended by golden cords so that it swayed with the castle in a manner which rocked its occupant delightfully to sleep
in which he had been held ever since his disappearance
who now saw him for the first time in his real shape
fearing lest his appearance might not be in keeping with the voice and language which had won her heart
at the same time she could not help feeling rather hurt at the apparent indifference with which she was received
she related all the dangers and difficulties she had gone through
though she repeated the story twenty times in a loud clear voice
on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously
but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer
on opening the crystal scentbottle a little syren flew out
who silenced the violins and then sang close to the prince's ear the story of all his lady love had suffered in her search for him
but before she had got far he was wide awake
at the same moment the walls of the room expanded and opened out
at the same time several elegant carriages filled with ladies in magnificent dresses drove up
in the first and most splendid of these carriages sat prince rainbow's mother
after which she informed him that his father had been dead for some years
that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased
that he might return in peace to reign over his people
the court received the new king with joyful acclamations which would have delighted him at any other time
he was just about to present her to his mother and the court
the queen taking the two lovers in her carriage set off with them for the capital of the kingdom
nor the mutual affection of king rainbow and his queen
who in the shape of a hawk used every night to break the windows of a certain village church
but in vain did the two eldest mount guard in the church with their guns as soon as the bird appeared high above their heads
then the youngest brother took his turn of guarding the windows
to prevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under his chin
so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head
at the same time a terrible desire to sleep overpowered him
but the thorns ran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once
in a moment he had seized his gun and shot at the bird
saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone
with their help dragged a lot of pinewood and ropes to the spot
they fastened some of the burning pinewood to the end of the rope
let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss
the flaming torch only lit up dirty grey stone walls
letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom
here he found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers
in the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle
everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper
the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl
who was combing her golden hair and he noticed that whenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like pure metal
the lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly but at the same time she warned him that she could never come up to the world above till her mother
then the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was made of silver
every hair that fell on the ground rang out like pure metal
but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it
at last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something to drink
but still he could not lift the sword then he drank a second
the sword began to move but only after he had drunk a third drop was he able to swing the sword over his head
then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch's arrival
at last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared
as soon as her feet touched the ground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman
he swung his mighty sword in the air with all his strength and the witch's head fell off
he packed up all the treasures of the castle into great chests
gave his brothers a signal to pull them up out of the abyss
first the treasures were attached to the rope and then the three lovely girls
now everything was up above and only he himself remained below
but as he was a little suspicious of his brothers
he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let them pull it up
but when the stone was half way up they let it drop suddenly
it fell to the bottom broken into a hundred pieces
so that's what would have happened to my bones had i trusted myself to them
said the youth sadly and he began to cry bitterly
but because of the lovely girl with her swanlike neck and golden hair
for a long time he wandered sadly all through the beautiful underworld
one day he met a magician who asked him the cause of his tears
if you will guard the children who are hidden in the golden appletree
i will bring you at once up to the earth
another magician who lives in this land always eats my children up
it is in vain that i have hidden them under the earth and locked them into the castle
now i have hidden them in the appletree hide yourself there too
a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree
the youth looked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up the tree
it wound itself round the stem and gradually got higher and higher
searching for the nest in which the little children lay
they trembled with terror when they saw the hideous creature
then the youth swung his mighty sword in the air
he cut up the rest of the body into little bits and strewed them to the four winds
the father of the rescued children was so delighted over the death of his enemy that he told the youth to get on his back
in this way he carried him up to the world above
with what joy did he hurry now to his brothers house
he burst into a room where they were all assembled
but the good youth forgave them all they had done
then he built himself a big castle with golden windows
there he lived happily with his goldenhaired wife till the end of their lives
once upon a time an indian hunter built himself a house in the middle of a great forest
far away from all his tribe for his heart was gentle and kind
he was weary of the treachery and cruel deeds of those who had been his friends
they journeyed on until they found a spot near to a clear stream
for many years they lived peacefully and happily in this sheltered place
will follow me ere many moons have waned to the island of the blest
followed her husband but before leaving her children she bade the two elder ones think of their promise never to forsake the younger
they tended him and cherished him but when the earth showed green again
he longed to see the wigwams of the village where his father's youth was spent
he took his bow and arrows and left the hut
yet he never returned and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard
then she also forgot the boy alone in the forest
now as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sister had left him
while the sun shone he was contented and had his fill
only crept out to eat what the wolves had left behind
it happened one day that his big brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore
he heard the voice of a child singing in the indian tone my brother
when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl
mourned the little boy and the broken promise till the end of his life
there was once upon a time a king and queen who had everything they could possibly wish for in this world except a child
the queen gave birth to a son but she did not live long to enjoy her happiness
but before her death she called her husband to her and said
never let the child put his feet on the ground
for as soon as he does so he will fall into the power of a wicked fairy
when he was too heavy for his nurse to carry
in which he could wander through the palace gardens without help at other times he was carried about on a litter
he was always carefully watched and guarded for fear he should at any time put his feet to the ground
but as this sort of life was bad for his health
accompanied always by his father's studgroom and a numerous retinue
every day he rode through the neighbouring fields and woods
more from use and wont than for any other reason
one day the prince and his suite went out for a ride in a wood where his father sometimes held a hunt
their way led through a stream whose banks were overgrown with thick brushwood
just as the horsemen were about to ford the river
started up from the grass and ran towards the thicket
when the girth of his saddle suddenly broke in two and he fell heavily to the ground
no sooner had his foot touched the earth than he disappeared before the eyes of the horrified courtiers
they were forced to recognise the power of the evil fairy
against which the queen had warned them on her deathbed
the old king was much grieved when they brought him the news of his son's disappearance
but as he could do nothing to free him from his fate
he gave himself up to an old age of grief and loneliness
cherishing at the same time the hope that some lucky chance might one day deliver the youth out of the hands of his enemy
hardly had the prince touched the ground than he felt himself violently seized by an unseen power
a splendid castle surrounded by a huge lake was the abode of the fairy
the only approach to it was over a bridge of clouds
on the other side of the lake high mountains rose up
dark woods stretched along the banks over all hung a thick mist
no sooner had the fairy reached her own domain than she made herself visible
turning to the prince she told him that unless he obeyed all her commands down to the minutest detail he would be severely punished
bade him cross the bridge of clouds and go into the wood beyond and cut down all the trees there before sunset
at the same time she cautioned him with many angry words against speaking to a black girl he would most likely meet in the wood
when she had finished took up the glass axe and set out for the forest
at every step he seemed to sink into the clouds
he crossed the lake in safety and set to work at once
but no sooner had he struck the first blow with his axe than it broke into a thousand pieces against the tree
the poor youth was so terrified he did not know what to do
for he was in mortal dread of the punishment the wicked old fairy would inflict on him
he did not know how long he had slept when a sudden sound awoke him
opening his eyes he saw a black girl standing beside him
mindful of the fairy's warning he did not dare to address her
but she on her part greeted him in the most friendly manner
asked him at once if he were under the power of the wicked fairy
then the black girl told him that she too was in the power of the fairy
on the other side of which the fairy's domain and power ended
the girl's words so inspired the prince with confidence that he told her all his tale of woe
that the fairy in whose power we both are is my own mother
if you will only promise to try and free me i will stand by you
will accomplish for you all the tasks which my mother sets you
the prince promised joyfully all she asked then having once more warned him not to betray her confidence
she handed him a draught to drink which very soon sunk his senses in a deep slumber
his astonishment was great when he awoke to find the glass axe whole and unbroken at his side
all the trees of the wood lying felled around him
she was much amazed when she heard that all the wood was cut down
since she could not believe that he had done all this by himself
she questioned him narrowly if he had seen or spoken to the black girl
swore he had never looked up from his work for a moment
showing him to a small dark cupboard she told him he might sleep there
morning had hardly dawned when the fairy awoke the prince
giving him the glass axe again she told him to cut up all the wood he had felled the day before
although his task was no easier than that of the day before
because he knew he could count an the help of the black girl
with quicker and lighter step he crossed the bridge of clouds
hardly had he reached the other side than his friend stood before him and greeted him cheerfully
which very soon caused the prince to sink into a deep sleep
all the trees of the wood were cut up into firewood and arranged in bundles ready for use
he returned to the castle as quickly as he could
she was even more amazed than she had been before
asked him again if he had either seen or spoken to the black girl but the prince knew better than to betray his word
on the following day the fairy set him a third task to do
she told him he must build a castle on the other side of the lake
so entirely did he rely on the help of his black friend
recognised at once the spot where the castle was to stand
every other building implement lay scattered on the ground ready for the workman's hand
but before the prince had time to feel despondent the black girl beckoned to him in the distance from behind a rock
where she had hidden herself for fear her mother should catch sight of her
begged her aid and counsel in the new piece of work he had been given to do
but this time the fairy had watched the prince's movements from her window
she saw him hiding himself behind the rock with her daughter
she uttered a piercing shriek so that the mountains reechoed with the sound of it
the terrified pair had hardly dared to look out from their hidingplace when the enraged woman
but the girl told him to be of good courage and to follow her as quickly as he could
but before they left their shelter she broke off a little bit of the rock
threw it in the direction her mother was coming from
in a moment a glittering palace arose before the eyes of the fairy which blinded her with its dazzling splendour
with its many doors and passages prevented her for some time from finding her way out of it
in the meantime the black girl hurried on with the prince
where once on the other side they would for ever be out of the wicked fairy's power
but before they had accomplished half the way they heard again the rustle of her garments and her muttered curses pursuing them closely
but before he had time to despair the girl uttered some more magic words
when the fairy saw this her rage knew no bounds
she used all her magic wits to make the pond disappear she caused a hill of sand to arise at her feet
but the sand hill only drove the pond a little farther away
when the old woman saw that the powers of her magic were of so little avail
she threw a lot of gold nuts into the pond
for the little creature refused to let itself be caught
hiding herself behind the rock which had sheltered the fugitives
watching carefully for the moment when the prince and her daughter should resume their natural forms and continue their journey
for as soon as the girl thought her mother was safely out of the way
she changed herself and the prince once more into their human shape
but they had not gone many steps when the wicked fairy hurried after them
she found herself in front of a great stone church
she tried to plunge her dagger into the monk's heart
in her desperation she determined to pull down the church
as soon as the fairy saw this she retreated to some distance from the building
so as not to be hurt herself by its fall
for hardly had she gone a yard from the church than both it and the monk disappeared
full of wolves and bears and wild animals of all sorts and descriptions
for she feared every moment to be torn in pieces by the beasts who one and all seemed to defy her power
she thought it wisest to make her way as best she could out of the forest
then to pursue the fugitives once more and accomplish their destruction either by force or cunning
in the meantime the prince and the black girl had again assumed their natural forms
were hurrying on as fast as they could to reach the river
but when they got there they found that there was no way in which they could cross it
the girl's magic art seemed no longer to have any power
but as you promised to do all you could to free me
take this bow and arrow and kill every beast you see with them
hardly had she done so than a huge wild boar started out of the thicket near and made straight for the prince
but the youth did not lose his presence of mind
drawing his bow he pierced the beast with his arrow right through the skull
the hare lay dead at his feet but at the same moment a dove rose up in the air
circled round the prince's head in the most confiding manner
taking another arrow from his quiver he laid it as dead as the boar and the hare
but when he went to look at the body of the bird he found instead of the dove a round white egg lying on the ground
while he was gazing on it and wondering what it could mean
looking up he saw a huge vulture with open claws swooping down upon him
in a moment he seized the egg and flung it at the bird with all his might
instead of the ugly monster the most beautiful girl he had ever seen stood before the astonished eyes of the prince
but while all this was going on the wicked old fairy had managed to make her way out of the wood
was now using the last resource in her power to overtake her daughter and the prince
as soon as she was in the open again she mounted her chariot
but just as she got to the river she saw the two lovers in each other's arms swimming through the water as easily as two fishes
but the waters seized her chariot and sunk it in the lowest depths
the waves bore the wicked old woman down the stream till she was caught in some thorn bushes
where she made a good meal for all the little fishes that were swimming about
so at last the prince and his lovely bride were free
they hurried as quickly as they could to the old king
on the following day a most gorgeous wedding feast was held
as far as we know the prince and his bride lived happily for ever afterwards
once upon a time there were a man and his wife who lived in the forest
but after a while the wife found that she had so many things to do that she was obliged to stay at home so he went alone
though he found that when his wife was not with him he never had any luck
at the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and found some wood by the door and a fire within
the next night there was not only wood and fire
he searched all about to see who could have done this
the next time he went to hunt he took care not to go far
while he was still a long way off he saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders
but you must not stretch out your hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people
now the camp of the tribe was distant six days journey
when they were yet one day's journey off it began to snow
we have seen no one yet it is too soon
when he saw it was the doll he pushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp
they went back with him to the place where he and his wife had stopped to rest
they saw in the snow the steps of two people
the foot of one was like the foot of the doll
the man grieved sore all the days of his life
who was lovelier than any other girl in the whole tribe
but she would listen to one only a handsome chief
the two looked forward to a long life of happiness together
when the very night before the wedding feast a sudden illness seized the girl
without a word to her friends who were weeping round her
the heart of her lover had been set upon her
the thought of her remained with him night and day
but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid
a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness
that there was a path that led to the land of souls that if you sought carefully you could find it
put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders
for he knew not how long his journey would take
nor what sort of country he would have to go through
as there seemed no reason he should go in one direction more than another
then all at once he thought he had heard one of the old men say that the land of souls lay to the south
many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home
the rivers all seemed exactly like the ones he had left
which had lain thick upon the hills and trees when he started
but grew less and less the farther he went south
instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head
then he knew that he was in the right road
the thought that he should soon behold his lost bride made his heart beat for joy
on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam
stood in the doorway and he said to the young chief who was beginning to tell his story
it is but a short while since she whom you seek was here
but his heart was too eager within him to suffer him to rest
but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him
seemed hardly to touch the ground and as he flew along the scents grew sweeter and the flowers more beautiful
fishes lifted up their heads and looked as he went by
but only the souls of them for this was the land of shadows
so he went on with winged feet till he came to the shores of a great lake
with a lovely island in the middle of it while on the bank of the lake was a canoe of glittering stone
when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey
for down in the depths of the water they saw the bones of those who had died before
though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds
the master of life had said that no evil should happen unto them
so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island
wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams
they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat
but in the murmur of the wind he heard the master of life saying to him
you shall take again your body which you left behind
in time to come you shall rejoin her whom you must now leave
as when i called her hence from the land of snows
the white duck once upon a time a great and powerful king married a lovely princess
no couple were ever so happy but before their honeymoon was over they were forced to part
for the king had to go on a warlike expedition to a far country
while her husband sought in vain to soothe her with words of comfort and counsel
the queen promised faithfully to obey her royal lord and master in these four matters
so when the king set out on his expedition she shut herself up with her ladies in her own apartments
it happened that one day while she was seated at the window
watch the sunbeams chase the dewdrops through the roseleaves and in the lilycups
all the brightness outside would help to drive away your cares
her husband but at last she thought to herself after all
what harm would it do if i were to go into the garden for a short time and enjoy myself among the trees and flowers
look at the dewdrops hiding from the sunbeams in the hearts of the roses and lilies
for she had no idea that the kindlooking old woman leaning on her crutch was in reality a wicked witch
the queen followed her out into the garden and listened to her smooth
in the middle of the garden there was a pond of water
the old woman said to the queen the day is so warm
that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting
answered the queen but the next moment she regretted her words
thought to herself why shouldn't i bathe in that cool
she slipped off her robes and stepped into the water
but scarcely had her tender feet touched the cool ripples when she felt a great shove on her shoulders
the wicked witch had pushed her into the deep water
in his great joy the king did not know that the woman he held in his arms was not his own dear wife
the poor white duck swam up and down the pond and near it laid three eggs
out of which there came one morning two little fluffy ducklings and a little ugly drake
quack as they strutted about on the green banks of the pond
but their mother used to warn them not to stray too far
telling them that a wicked witch lived in the castle beyond the garden
but the young ones did not listen to their mother
ground her teeth with anger but she hid her feelings
pretending to be very kind she called them to her and joked with them
showed them a soft cushion on which they might sleep
then she left them and went down into the palace kitchens
in the meantime the two little ducklings had fallen asleep
as he lay there wide awake in the night he heard the witch come to the door and say little ones
the little drake answered for the other two we can not sleep
muttered the witch to herself and she walked up and down in the passage
again the little drake answered for his sisters we can not sleep
muttered the witch i think ill go in and see
the next morning the white duck wandered round the pond in a distracted manner
looking for her little ones she called and she searched
in her heart she had a foreboding that evil had befallen them
she fluttered up out of the water and flew to the palace
i gave you always of the best i kept you warm in my soft nest
i loved and watched you day and night you were my joy
the king heard the sad complaint of the white duck
they could not get rid of the duck for she circled round and round
always came back to the spot where her children lay
the wicked witch your lives did take the wicked witch
would i were the queen again would that you had never been slain
as the king heard her words he began to suspect that he had been deceived
as he stroked her wings she was changed into a beautiful woman
she told him that a bottle would be found in her nest in the garden
it was brought to her and the ducklings and little drake were sprinkled with the water
the king and queen were overjoyed when they saw their children
but the wicked witch was taken by the king's command
long time ago there lived a king who had three sons the eldest was called szabo
one beautiful spring morning the king was walking through his gardens with these three sons
whilst others were bowed to the ground laden with rich fruit
during their wanderings they came unperceived on a piece of waste land where three splendid trees grew
were planted by me on this spot when i was a youth of twenty
promised him that they would grow into the three finest trees the world had ever seen
my father did not live to see his words come true but on his deathbed he bade me transplant them here
a few days later the most exquisite fruit my eyes had ever seen
i gave my headgardener the strictest orders to watch the trees carefully
for the magician had warned my father that if one unripe fruit were plucked from the tree
when it was quite ripe the fruit would become a golden yellow
it was all i could do not to break the magician's commands
one night i dreamt that the fruit was perfectly ripe i ate some of it
it was more delicious than anything i had ever tasted in real life
as soon as i awoke i sent for the gardener and asked him if the fruit on the three trees had not ripened in the night to perfection
the gardener threw himself at my feet and swore that he was innocent
he said that he had watched by the trees all night
the beautiful trees had been robbed of all their fruit
but i determined to pluck off all the fruit in the following year before it was ripe
as i had not much belief in the magician's warning
but when i tasted one of the apples it was bitter and unpleasant
the next morning the rest of the fruit had all rotted away
after this i had the beautiful fruit of these trees carefully guarded by my most faithful servants but every year
the fruit was plucked and stolen by an invisible hand
next morning not a single apple remained on the trees
for some time past i have given up even having the trees watched
i am sure there are many men in your kingdom who could protect these trees from the cunning arts of a thieving magician i myself
who as your eldest son claim the first right to do so
as soon as evening drew on szabo climbed up on to one of the trees
determined to protect the fruit even if it cost him his life
so he kept watch half the night but a little after midnight he was overcome by an irresistible drowsiness
then it came to the turn of the third and youngest son
iwanich was not the least discouraged by the failure of his elder brothers
though they were both much older and stronger than he was
when night came climbed up the tree as they had done
so that the observant prince could distinguish the smallest object distinctly
at the same moment a snowwhite swanlike bird sank down gently on his breast
the prince hastily seized the bird's wings in his hands
to his astonishment he found he was holding in his arms not a bird but the most beautiful girl he had ever seen
an evil magician has not robbed you of your fruit
when she was dying she bade me take the fruit
from the trees every year as soon as it was ripe
who had been prepared to meet a terrible magician and not a lovely girl
they spent the rest of the night in pleasant conversation
when militza wished to go away he begged her not to leave him
but a wicked witch once cut off a lock of my hair when i was asleep
if morning were still to find me here she would do me some harm
think of her sometimes if you never see her again
if you have love and courage enough to undertake this journey
whenever you come to a crossroad always look at this diamond before you settle which way you are going to take
if it sparkles as brightly as ever go straight on
then militza bent over the prince and kissed him on his forehead
before he had time to say a word she vanished through the branches of the tree in a little white cloud
left his perch and returned to the palace like one in a dream
without even knowing if the fruit had been taken or not for his whole mind was absorbed by thoughts of militza and how he was to find her
as soon as the headgardener saw the prince going towards the palace he ran to the trees
when he saw them laden with ripe fruit he hastened to tell the king the joyful news
hurried at once to the garden and made the gardener pick him some of the fruit
found the apple quite as luscious as it had been in his dream
he asked him how he had succeeded in protecting the costly fruit from the power of the magician
but as he did not want the real story to be known
he said that about midnight a huge wasp had flown through the branches
the wasp had vanished as suddenly as it had appeared
everyone shared in the king's joy the prince alone took no part in the festivities
he sped off like the wind without a single soul being any the wiser
it was only on the next day that they missed him the king was very distressed at his disappearance
sent searchparties all over the kingdom to look for him
but in vain and after six months they gave him up as dead
in another six months they had forgotten all about him
at the end of three months he came to the entrance of a huge forest
which looked as if it had never been trodden by human foot before
the prince was about to enter the wood by a little path he had discovered
leaning on a crooked staff and seated at the foot of an oak tree
which was so much the same colour as himself that it was little wonder the prince had ridden past the tree without noticing him
it's easily seen that you have heard nothing of this forest
listen to me before you ride any further let me tell you that this wood hides in its depths a countless number of the fiercest tigers
if i were to cut you and your horse up into tiny morsels and throw them to the beasts
there wouldn't be one bit for each hundred of them
if you wish to save your life follow some other path
the prince was rather taken aback by the old man's words
considered for a minute what he should do then looking at his ring
he called out if this wood held even more terrible things than it does
here he spurred his horse and rode on but the old beggar screamed so loudly after him that the prince turned round and rode back to the oak tree
but if you are quite determined to brave the dangers of the forest
let me at least give you a piece of advice which will help you against these monsters
as i am anxious to save your life but you must leave your horse behind you
for it would stumble over the fallen trees or get entangled in the briers and thorns
when you have gone about a hundred yards into the wood the wild beasts will surround you
in this way you will be able to get through the wood unhurt
he had hardly lost sight of his gaunt grey friend when he heard growls and snarls in the thicket close to him
before he had time to think he found himself surrounded by the most dreadfullooking creatures
on one side he saw the glittering eye of a cruel tiger
on the other the gleaming teeth of a great shewolf here a huge bear growled fiercely
there a horrible snake coiled itself in the grass at his feet
quickly put his hand into the bag and took out as many breadcrumbs as he could hold in his hand at a time
then he seized the hare and threw it to them
no sooner did the little creature feel itself on the ground than it lay back its ears and flew through the wood like an arrow from a bow
when he saw that it sparkled as brightly as ever he went straight on through the forest
he hadn't gone very far when he saw a most extraordinary looking man coming towards him
all his body was covered with prickles like a hedgehog
fastened to his side by the two ends of his long beard
he stopped the prince and asked him in a harsh voice are you the man who has just fed my bodyguard
but the little man continued i am most grateful to you for your kindness what can i give you as a reward
that i should be allowed to go through this wood in safety
answered the little man and for greater security i will give you one of my lions as a protector
but when you leave this wood and come near a palace which does not belong to my domain
in order that he may not fall into the hands of an enemy and be killed
with these words he loosened the lion from his beard and bade the beast guard the youth carefully
with this new protector iwanich wandered on through the forest
they always kept at a respectful distance when they saw what sort of an escort the prince had with him
iwanich hurried through the wood as quickly as his legs would carry him
hour after hour went by and not a trace of a green field or a human habitation met his eyes
at the exit of the wood the lion stood still
iwanich was forced to wait for daylight before continuing his journey
then he got up and walked towards a beautiful white palace which he saw gleaming in the distance
as soon as militza saw the prince she ran up to him and embraced him tenderly and after he had told her all his adventures
which was held soon after with great pomp and magnificence
when militza received one day an invitation to visit her mother's sister
although the princess was very unhappy at leaving her husband
said before i go i will hand you over all the keys of the castle
go everywhere and do anything you like only one thing i beg and beseech you
do not open the little iron door in the north tower
which is closed with seven locks and seven bolts for if you do
when the prince found himself alone he began to be tormented by pangs of curiosity as to what the room in the tower contained
for two days he resisted the temptation to go and look
but on the third he could stand it no longer
taking a torch in his hand he hurried to the tower
unfastened one lock after the other of the little iron door until it burst open
lit up feebly by a fire from which issued long blue flames
over the fire hung a huge cauldron full of boiling pitch
fastened into the cauldron by iron chains stood a wretched man screaming with agony
asked the man what terrible crime he had committed to be punished in this dreadful fashion
said the man in the cauldron but first relieve my torments a little
replied the man only sprinkle a few drops over me and i shall feel better
as if all the pillars of the palace were giving way
iwanich found himself suddenly alone upon a desolate heath covered with rocks and stones
the owner of it was none other than the kindhearted gaunt grey beggar who had given the prince the bag of breadcrumbs and the hare
he opened the door when he knocked and gave him shelter for the night
on the following morning the prince asked his host if he could get him any work to do
all this country round here is uninhabited i myself have to wander to distant villages for my living
even then i do not very often find enough to satisfy my hunger
but if you would like to take service with the old witch corva
go straight up the little stream which flows below my hut for about three hours
you will come to a sandhill on the lefthand side that is where she lives
for the old witch had surrounded her dwelling with a fence of spikes
on every one of which a man's skull was stuck
in the presence of a hideous old woman who was warming her skinny hands at a fire
the old hag told him she was badly in want of one
he seemed to be just the person to suit her
led the way through a narrow damp passage into a vault
a mare and her foal you have nothing to do but to lead them out to the fields every day
to see that neither of them runs away from you
if you look after them both for a whole year i will give you anything you like to ask but if
your head shall be stuck on the last spike of my fence
the skulls are all those of different servants i have had who have failed to do what i demanded
who thought he could not be much worse off than he was already
at daybreak nest morning he drove his horses to the field
brought them back in the evening without their ever having attempted to break away from him
the witch stood at her door and received him kindly
early every morning he led the horses out to the fields
which through some mischance had been cast on the land
seized it in his arms and flung it into the stream
but no sooner did the fish find itself in the water again
it swam up to the bank and said my kind benefactor
i am quite content to have been able to be of some service to you
loosened a scale from the body of the grateful beast
when he was going early one morning to the usual grazing place with his horses
he noticed a flock of birds assembled together making a great noise and flying wildly backwards and forwards
saw that a large number of ravens had attacked an eagle
although the eagle was big and powerful and was making a brave fight
seized the branch of a tree and hit out at the ravens with it terrified at this unexpected onslaught they flew away
leaving many of their number dead or wounded on the battlefield
as soon as the eagle saw itself free from its tormentors it plucked a feather from its wing
take this feather as a proof of my gratitude should you ever be in need of my help blow this feather into the air
i will help you as much as is in my power
placing the feather beside the scale he drove the horses home
came close to a farmyard the place pleased the prince
as there was plenty of good grass for the horses he determined to spend the day there
just as he was sitting down under a tree he heard a cry close to him
saw a fox which had been caught in a trap placed there by the farmer
in vain did the poor beast try to free itself then the goodnatured prince came once more to the rescue
said should you ever stand in need of my help throw these two hairs into the fire
in a moment i shall be at your side ready to obey you
iwanich put the fox's hairs with the scale and the feather
as it was getting dark he hastened home with his horses
in the meantime his service was drawing near to an end
he would be able to get his reward and leave the witch
the prince followed her secretly to see what she was going to do
he crouched down in the doorway and heard the wicked witch telling the horses to wait next morning till iwanich was asleep
to stay there till she told them to return and if they didn't do as she told them the old woman threatened to beat them till they bled
when iwanich heard all this he went back to his room
determined that nothing should induce him to fall asleep next day
on the following morning he led the mare and foal to the fields as usual
but bound a cord round them both which he kept in his hand
the mare and foal escaped and did as they had been told to do
the prince did not awake till late in the evening and when he did
he cursed the moment when he had entered the service of the cruel witch
already he saw his head sticking up on the sharp spike beside the others
in a minute the grateful fish swam towards the bank on which iwanich was standing
the prince replied i had to look after a mare and foal
they have run away from me and have hidden themselves in the river if you wish to save my life drive them back to the land
i and my friends will soon drive them out of the water
with these words the creature disappeared into the depths of the stream
almost immediately a rushing hissing sound was heard in the waters
the two horses leapt suddenly on to the dry land
when the witch saw the prince bringing the horses home she could hardly conceal her wrath
as soon as she had placed iwanich's supper before him she stole away again to the stables
heard her scolding the beasts harshly for not having hidden themselves better
she bade them wait next morning till iwanich was asleep and then to hide themselves in the clouds
if they did not do as she told them she would beat them till they bled
the horses at once ran away and hid themselves in the clouds
which hung down from the mountains in soft billowy masses
when the prince awoke and found that both the mare and the foal had disappeared
taking the feather out of his pocket he blew it into the air
in a moment the bird swooped down beside him and asked what do you wish me to do
have hidden themselves in the clouds if you wish to save my life
answered the eagle with the help of my friends i will soon drive them back to you
with these words the bird flew up into the air and disappeared among the clouds
almost directly iwanich saw his two horses being driven towards him by a host of eagles of all sizes
having thanked the eagle he drove them cheerfully home again
the old witch was more disgusted than ever when she saw him appearing
having set his supper before him she stole into the stables
iwanich heard her abusing the horses for not having hidden themselves better in the clouds
if they failed to do as she told them she would certainly beat them this time till they bled
on the following morning the prince drove his horses as usual to the fields
the mare and foal ran away and hid themselves in the royal hen house
when the prince awoke and found the horses gone he determined to appeal to the fox so
in a few moments the fox stood beside him and asked in what way can i serve you
while they were walking along the fox asked him what he wanted to do at the royal henhouse
the prince told him of the misfortune that had befallen him
in the meantime i will slip in among the hens through a hole in the wall and give them a good chase
so that the noise they make will arouse the royal henwives
when they see the horses they will at once imagine them to be the cause of the disturbance
then you must lay hands on the mare and foal and catch them
all turned out exactly as the sly fox had foreseen
now you may ask what reward you like for your service
if you promise never to betray me i will give you a piece of advice which you will do well to follow
the mare continued ask nothing else as a reward than my foal
is not to be bought for love or money for it can go from one end of the earth to another in a few minutes
of course the cunning corva will do her best to dissuade you from taking the foal
will tell you that it is both idle and sickly but do not believe her
this time corva received him in the most friendly manner
as soon as he had finished she asked him what reward he demanded for his year's service
the witch pretended to be much astonished at his request
said that he deserved something much better than the foal
when the old witch saw that he had made up his mind to have the foal
i am obliged to keep my promise and to hand you over the foal and as i know who you are and what you want
i will tell you in what way the animal will be useful to you
is a mighty magician through your curiosity and thoughtlessness militza came into his power
he has transported her and her castle and belongings into a distant country
you are the only person who can kill him and in consequence he fears you to such an extent that he has set spies to watch you
or you will fall into the power of his friends
seize him at once by the beard and dash him to the ground
when iwanich perceived some figures in the distance they soon came up to them
then the prince saw that it was the magician and his friends who were driving through the air in a carriage drawn by owls
when the magician found himself face to face with iwanich
he turned to him with false friendliness and said thrice my kind benefactor
seized him at once by his beard and dashed him to the ground
at the same moment the foal sprang on the top of the magician and kicked and stamped on him with his hoofs till he died
then iwanich found himself once more in the palace of his bride
from this time forward they lived in undisturbed peace and happiness till the end of their lives
the magic ring once upon a time there lived an old couple who had one son called martin
though all his life long he had toiled and moiled
he only left his widow and son two hundred florins
the old woman determined to put by the money for a rainy day but alas
who is prepared to face starvation with two hundred florins at their disposal
so the old woman counted out a hundred of her florins
told him to go into the town and lay in a store of meal for a year
when he reached the meatmarket he found the whole place in turmoil
a great noise of angry voices and barking of dogs
he noticed a staghound which the butchers had caught and tied to a post
answered the butchers derisively but for such a treasure we won't take a penny less than a hundred florins
when there was scarcely a handful of meal in the house
to have spent the money on a useless brute like that
on the following day she sent him back to the town
i have just emptied the last grains of meal out of the chest
just as martin was entering the town he met a roughlooking peasant who was dragging a cat after him by a string which was fastened round the poor beast's neck
when he reached his home his mother greeted him with the question well
i had no money over to buy anything else with
go and beg your bread among strangers and as martin did not dare to contradict her
he called schurka and waska and started off with them to the nearest village in search of work
but i must tell you i engage my labourers without wages
when the day of reckoning had come the peasant led him into a barn
seeing that one was full of silver and the other of sand
he said to himself there must be some trick about this i had better take the sand
throwing the sack over his shoulders he started out into the world
in the middle of the wood he came upon a meadow
extinguish the flames with the sand that you earned in payment of your faithful service
it would be more sensible to save a fellowbeing's life with this sand than to drag it about on one's back
forthwith he lowered the sack from his shoulders and emptied its contents on the flames
instantly the fire was extinguished but at the same moment lo
whispered lovingly in his ear do not be afraid of me
but first you must follow me boldly into my father's kingdom
for the ring which he wears on his little finger
for in that ring lies a magic power you have only to throw it from one hand to the other
after much wandering they reached a spot where a great rock rose straight up in the middle of the road
she showed him an opening just big enough for a man to wriggle through
in the middle of the field stood a magnificent castle
his beautiful guide told him that this was the palace in which her father lived and reigned over his kingdom in the underworld
i had almost given up the hope of ever seeing you again
upon which the king turned to martin with a gracious smile
saying i will reward your courage by granting you whatever your heart desires
or precious stones yet if you will grant me a favour
the ring from off the little finger of your royal hand
every time my eye falls on it i shall think of your gracious majesty
when i marry i shall present it to my bride
so the king took the ring from his finger and gave it to martin
good youth but with it i make one condition you are never to confide to anyone that this is a magic ring
he set out on the same road by which he had come down into the underworld
when he had regained the upper air he started for his old home
having found his mother still living in the old house where he had left her
so uneventful was their life that it almost seemed as if it would go on in this way always
but one day it suddenly came into his mind that he would like to get married
that he would choose a very grand wife a king's daughter
but as he did not trust himself as a wooer
he determined to send his old mother on the mission
demand the hand of his lovely daughter in marriage for me
why can not you marry someone in your own rank
that would be far more fitting than to send a poor old woman like me awooing to the king's court for the hand of a princess
neither my life nor yours would be worth anything if i went on such a fool's errand
but see that you do not come back without an answer of some kind
began to mount the flight of steps leading to the royal presence chamber
at the head of the landing rows of courtiers were collected in magnificent attire
but their stern words and forbidding gestures made no impression whatever on the old woman
upon this some of the courtiers seized her by the arms
at which she set up such a yell that the king himself heard it
stepped out on to the balcony to see what was the matter
when he beheld the old woman flinging her arms wildly about
heard her scream that she would not leave the place till she had laid her case before the king
he ordered that she should be brought into his presence
replied martin's mother and your majesty must not be angry with me i have come awooing
but martin's mother answered boldly if the king will only listen patiently to me
he will see that i am not out of my mind
i have a son a wooer as clever a youth and as good a soninlaw as you will find in your whole kingdom
will you give your daughter to my son as wife
the king listened to the end of the old woman's strange request
his features sterner till all at once he thought to himself
all the courtiers and counsellors were amazed when they saw the hard lines round his mouth and the frown on his brow grow smooth
heard the mild but mocking tones in which he answered the old woman
saying if your son is as wonderfully clever as you say
if there is nothing in the world that he can not do
the palace must be joined together by a bridge of pure crystal
on each side of the bridge there must be growing trees
at the right of the bridge there must be a church
with five golden cupolas in this church your son shall be wedded to my daughter
we will keep the wedding festivities in the new castle
but if he fails to execute this my royal command
i shall give orders that you and he are taken
you shall be executed in the marketplace for the entertainment of my courtiers
a smile played round the king's lips as he finished speaking
his courtiers and counsellors shook with laughter when they thought of the old woman's folly
what a joke it will be when we see the pair of them tarred and feathered
the son is just as able to grow a beard on the palm of his hand as to execute such a task in twentyfour hours
in a trembling voice she asked is that really your royal will
he shall be rewarded with my daughter but if he fails
away to the tarbarrel and the stake with you both
on her way home the poor old woman shed bitter tears
when she saw martin she told him what the king had said
it would have been better for us this day if you had
my going to court has been as much as our lives are worth
martin threw his ring from the palm of one hand into the other
they answered that by next morning all should be accomplished exactly as the king had ordered
as if they would summon people from all corners of the earth to come and behold the wonder
though the king would much rather have seen his future soninlaw tarred
so that to this day the old people in the country still talk of it
after the wedding martin and his royal bride went to dwell in the magnificent new palace
but though he was as happy as the day was long
thinking of the indignity that had been done her in making her marry martin
instead of a rich young prince from a foreign country
so unhappy was she that she spent all her time wondering how she should get rid of her undesirable husband
first she determined to learn the secret of his power
she tried to coax him to tell her how he was so clever that there was nothing in the world that he could not do
she approached him with a winning smile on her lovely face
he told her that all his power lay in the magic ring that he wore on his finger
she threw it from the palm of one hand into the other
then she told them that by the next morning they were to do away with the castle
put in their stead the humble hut in which martin used to live with his mother
where an old king lived who would make her welcome in his palace
surround her with the state that befitted a royal princess
when the king awoke and looked out of his window he beheld to his amazement that the palace
having made away with the princess and he was condemned to imprisonment in a high stone tower
his old friends schurka remembered how martin had once saved them from a cruel death and they took counsel together as to how they should help him
was of opinion that he would like to tear everyone in pieces but waska purred meditatively
scratched the back of her ear with a velvet paw
at the end of a few minutes she had made up her mind
the moment we meet a baker you must make a rush between his legs and upset the tray from off his head i will lay hold of the rolls
together the two faithful creatures trotted off into the town
very soon they met a baker bearing a tray on his head
at that moment schurka made a rush between his legs the baker stumbled
waska managed to drag the rolls out of sight behind a bush
they set off at full tilt to the stone tower where martin was a prisoner
in another moment she had climbed down and brought him back a roll
schurka and i are going off to a distant kingdom at the utmost ends of the earth to fetch you back your magic ring
you must be careful that the rolls last till our return
looking always to right and left for traces of the princess
they began to make friends with all the dogs and cats in the place
to question them about the princess and the magic ring but no one could tell them much about either
now one day it chanced that waska had gone down to the palace cellar to hunt for mice and rats
when she was stopped by the pleading tones of the little creature
if you will only spare my life i may be of great service to you
i will do everything in my power for you for i am the king of the mice
i will spare your life but in return you must do something for me
you must get it away from her at whatever cost do you hear
till you have done this i won't take my claws out of your fur
instantly a tiny mouse stepped forward and said i often creep about the princess's bedroom at night
i have noticed that she has a ring which she treasures as the apple of her eye
the tiny mouse tripped away into the bedroom of the princess
through which it dragged one by one little down feathers
the ring fell out of her mouth on to the coverlet
brought it to waska as a ransom for the king of the mice
travelled night and day till they reached the stone tower where martin was imprisoned and the cat climbed up the window
replied waska from this day forth you will know nothing but happiness and prosperity
if this were a moment to trouble you with riddles
i would make you guess what schurka and i have brought you back
instantly the twelve youths appeared and asked what they were to do
as quickly as possible and after that bring musicians hither
now when the people in the town and palace heard music coming from the tower they were filled with amazement
came to the king with the news that witchcraft must be going on in martin's tower
he was seemingly making merry to the sound of music
knives and forks and the music was so enchantingly sweet that all the passersby stood still to listen to it
on this the king sent at once a messenger to the starvation tower
he was so astonished with what he saw that he remained rooted to the spot
he likewise was spellbound by the beauty of the music
join it to the king's palace with a crystal bridge do not forget the trees with the golden and silver apples
with the birds of paradise in the branches and put back the church with the five cupolas
summoning the people from the four corners of the kingdom
i have suffered much at the hands of your daughter
let your anger be turned to grace forgive my daughter
he never parted with schurka and waska and i need hardly tell you that he never again let the ring out of his possession
a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him
when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch
who begged him to help her out of the ditch
the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave
asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there
where i might have remained for ever but for your kindness
you can hardly walk i will put you on my horse and lead you home
at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance
but at the same time you have a kind heart
would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife
the most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the queen of the flowers
i will give you this little bell if you ring it once
the king of the eagles will appear if you ring it twice
the king of the foxes will come to you and if you ring it three times
you will see the king of the fishes by your side
these will help you if you are in any difficulty
then it dawned on the prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy
he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the flower queen free
intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid
so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home
he had roamed round the world for a whole year
while he himself had suffered much from want and misery
but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of
do you not know where the dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the flower queen prisoner
but if you go straight along this road for a year
continued his journey for a whole year along the same road
at the end of it came to the little hut
you will come to a hut in which my father lives
at last reached the hut where he found the third old man
he put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson but this time the old man answered
but if you wish to see the flower queen's daughter go up the second mountain the dragon's old mother lives there
where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows
when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted
i have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the dragon's mother
they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls
in the twelfth room they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne
i have heard so much of your beauty and kindness
that i would very much like to enter your service
said the mother dragon but if you wish to enter my service
you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days but if you don't bring her home safely every evening
the prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow
but no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished
at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate
taking it out of his pocket he rang it once
in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him
you are looking for the mother dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds
i will summon all the eagles of the air together
order them to catch the mare and bring her to you
with these words the king of the eagles flew away
towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air
when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them
they sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him
then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon
as a reward you shall come to my ball tonight
she gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper
led him to a big room where several young hedragons and shedragons were dancing together
her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world
as the prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear
if you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day
ask the mother dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward
early next morning the prince again led the mother dragon's mare out into the meadow
then he took out his little bell and rang it twice
in a moment the king of the foxes stood before him and said i know already what you want
will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill
in the evening many thousand foxes brought the mare to the prince
from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver
the flower queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound
when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear if you succeed again tomorrow
on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again but once more she vanished before his eyes
then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times
said to him i know quite well what you want me to do
i will summon all the fishes of the sea together
when he led her home to the mother dragon she said to him you are a brave youth
but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with
for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty
so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak but before the entertainment was over he slipped away
where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the flower queen's daughter
the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen's dwelling
he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened
determined to lay siege to the flower queen's palace but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling
when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince
she said to him i will give my consent to your marriage gladly
but my daughter can only stay with you in summer
when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow
she must come and live with me in my palace underground
where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence
when the flower queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother
when the flower queen's daughter went back again to her mother
once upon a time there lived an old couple who had three sons the two elder were clever
always spoke pleasantly to her but the youngest was always getting in her way
one day it was announced in the village that the king had issued a decree
in marriage to whoever should build a ship that could fly
immediately the two elder brothers determined to try their luck
when they had gone the poor simpleton began to tease his mother to smarten him up and let him start off
the mother gave him a crust of bread and a bottle of water
when he had gone a short distance he met a little old manikin
he has promised to give his daughter to whoever can make a flying ship
sit down beside me we can rest for a little and have something to eat
the poor simpleton was ashamed to show what was in it
he saw two beautiful fresh rolls and some cold meat
when he got to the first tree he stopped in front of it
kneeling on the ground with his face to the earth
after a little time he was aroused he awoke and
cast his eyes down to the earth and saw a man beneath him on the road
who was kneeling with his ear upon the damp ground
i am listening to what is going on in the world
till again from his outlook the simpleton saw a man on the road below
while his other leg was tied up behind his ear
i walk so fast that unless i tied up one leg i should be at the end of the earth in a bound
beheld a man aiming with a gun into the distance
what would be the good of my taking a near shot
replied the man i can hit beast or bird at a hundred miles distance
answered the simpleton and the man was only too glad to join them
till again the simpleton from his outlook saw a man on the road below
you have got a whole basketload of it on your back
answered the man i should finish that in one mouthful
till the simpleton from his outlook saw a man walking by the shore of a great lake
there's a whole lake in front of you why don't you drink some of that
so the mighty drinker was added to the company and the ship flew farther
this time he saw a man dragging a bundle of wood
so he too joined them and away the ship flew on
this time he saw a man carrying straw upon his back
do you mean to say there is no straw in the village
if you strew it about even in the hottest summer the air at once becomes cold
but he at once despatched one of his courtiers to find out what the huge
strange new bird could be that had come flying through the air
instantly went back to the king and told him that it was a flying ship
then the king remembered his royal oath but he made up his mind that he would never consent to let the princess marry a poor peasant
then said to himself i will give him some impossible tasks to perform that will be the best way of getting rid of him
he there and then decided to despatch one of his courtiers to the simpleton
with the command that he was to fetch the king the healing water from the world's end before he had finished his dinner
but while the king was still instructing the courtier exactly what he was to say
that his orders shall be obeyed and forthwith the swift runner unbound the foot that was strung up behind his ear and started off
in less than no time had reached the world's end and drawn the healing water from the well
ill just rest for a few minutes it will be some little time yet before the king has got to dessert
in the meantime all the ship's crew were anxiously awaiting him the king's dinner would soon be finished
so the man with the marvellous quick hearing lay down and
so while the king was still sitting at table finishing his dinner news was brought to him that his orders had been obeyed to the letter
the king determined to think of a still more impossible task
so he told another courtier to go to the simpleton with the command that he and his comrades were instantly to eat up twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread
once more the sharpeared comrade overheard the king's words while he was still talking to the courtier
to eat up twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread
so when the courtier arrived with the royal message he was told to take back word to the king that his orders should be obeyed
then twelve roasted oxen and twelve tons of bread were brought alongside of the ship
were to be drunk up on the spot by the simpleton and his party
when these words were overheard by the sharpeared comrade and repeated to the simpleton
when the forty casks of wine containing forty gallons each were brought alongside of the ship
they disappeared down the thirsty comrade's throat in no time and when they were empty he remarked why
then the king took counsel with himself and sent an order to the simpleton that he was to have a bath
the king gave orders that it was to be heated to such a pitch that it would suffocate the simpleton
his comrade with the straw on his back had entered behind him
when the door was shut upon them he scattered the straw about
it became so very cold that the simpleton could scarcely bear to take a bath
in the morning when they opened the door there he lay sound and safe
now when this strange tale was told to the king he became quite sad
not knowing what he should do to get rid of so undesirable a soninlaw
the quickeared comrade had overheard the king's command and repeated it to the simpleton
not forgetting to take the bundle of wood with them
which the man spread out in all directions and in a moment a mighty army stood upon the spot
regiment on regiment of foot and horse soldiers the bugles sounded and the drums beat
in the morning when the king awoke he was startled by these warlike sounds
he saw the lances gleam in the sunlight and the armour and weapons glitter
commanded him to come to the palace to be married to the princess
he looked so grand and stately that it was impossible to recognise the poor simpleton
so changed was he and the princess fell in love with him as soon as ever she saw him
there was so much food and wine that even the glutton and the thirsty comrade had enough to eat and drink
there was once upon a time a man and his wife
the woman was looking at all the little icicles which hung from the roof
i wish i had as many children as there are icicles hanging there
perhaps i shall give birth to a snow child now
but after a short time the woman gave birth to a little girl
who was as white as snow and as cold as ice
it screamed loudly till they put it back into some cool place
in a few months she could run about and speak
for all summer she insisted on spending in the cellar
in the winter she would sleep outside in the snow
the colder it was the happier she seemed to be
who was disporting herself in the snowstorm that raged outside
a spark from the big wood fire flew into the woman's lap
but he ceased to think it a joke when his wife shortly afterwards gave birth to a boy
who screamed lustily till he was put quite close to the fire
who nearly yelled himself into a fit if the snowdaughter came anywhere near him
the snowdaughter herself avoided him as much as she could
always crept into a corner as far away from him as possible
they had a great deal of trouble and worry with him too but he throve and grew very quickly
before he was a year old he could run about and talk
he always sat on the hearth quite close to the fire
complained of the cold if his sister were in the room he almost crept into the flames
while the girl on her part always complained of the great heat if her brother were anywhere near
in summer the boy always lay out in the sun
while the girl hid herself in the cellar so it happened that the brother and sister came very little into contact with each other in fact
just as the girl grew up into a beautiful woman
her father and mother both died one after the other
who had grown up in the meantime into a fine
i have a feeling that if we set out together we shall be lucky
but at the same time i always freeze if you are near me
how shall we travel about together without being odious the one to the other
have settled on a plan which will make us each able to bear with the other
i have had a fur cloak made for each of us
if we put them on i shall not feel the heat so much nor you the cold
for the first time in their lives quite happy in each other's company
for a long time the fireson and the snowdaughter wandered through the world
when at the beginning of winter they came to a big wood they determined to stay there till spring
the fireson built himself a hut where he always kept up a huge fire
while his sister with very few clothes on stayed outside night and day
now it happened one day that the king of the land held a hunt in this wood
he wondered very much who the beautiful girl clad in such garments could be
the king had a huge house of ice made for his wife underground
but for his brotherinlaw he had a house built with huge ovens all round it
but the perpetual heat in which he lived made his body so hot
that it was dangerous to go too close to him
if i had known what a lot of trouble you would have been
i love heat and my sister loves cold come here and let me embrace you
who had taken refuge from her brother in the next room
the king lay dead on the ground burnt to a cinder
when the snowdaughter saw this she turned on her brother and flew at him
the like of which had never been seen on earth
they saw the snowdaughter melting into water and the fireson burn to a cinder
there was once upon a time a peasantwoman who had a daughter and a stepdaughter
whatever she did was right in her mother's eyes but the poor stepdaughter had a hard time
got small thanks for all the trouble she took nothing was right
the girl was worth her weight in gold she was so unselfish and goodhearted
the poor girl's days were spent in weeping for it was impossible to live peacefully with the woman
the wicked shrew was determined to get rid of the girl by fair means or foul
old man send her away anywhere so that my eyes shan' t be plagued any longer by the sight of her
or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice
in vain did the poor old father weep and implore her pity she was firm
not even daring to give her a horsecloth to keep herself warm with
the poor girl sat down under a firtree at the edge of the forest and began to weep silently
suddenly she heard a faint sound it was king frost springing from tree to tree
at length he reached the firtree beneath which she was sitting
the air seemed to be full of knives and darts and again he asked maiden
the poor girl was so stiff and numb that she could just gasp
in which were beautiful jewels and a rich robe embroidered in gold and silver
in the meantime the wicked stepmother was waiting at home for news of the girl's death
you had better go out into the fields and find your daughter's body and bury her
just as the old man was leaving the house the little dog under the table began to bark
saying your daughter shall live to be your delight her daughter shall die this very night
but you must say her daughter shall have much silver and gold his daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold
saying his daughter shall wear a crown on her head her daughter shall die unwooed
then the old woman tried to coax the doggie with more pancakes and to terrify it with blows
what a blind old fool you must be to ask such a question
can't you see that my hands and feet are nearly frozen
then king frost sprang to and fro in front of her
but in the hut her mother was waiting for her return
as she grew impatient she said to her husband get out the horses
to go and fetch her home but see that you are careful not to upset the sledge and lose the chest
there's a cake for you now say her daughter shall marry a mighty king
as she took her frozen body in her arms she too was chilled to death
many thousand years ago there lived a mighty king whom heaven had blessed with a clever and beautiful son
when he was only ten years old the boy was cleverer than all the king's counsellors put together
when he was twenty he was the greatest hero in the whole kingdom
always had him clothed in golden garments which shone and sparkled like the sun and his mother gave him a white horse
for they did not think his like existed under the sun
now it happened one night that both his parents had the same extraordinary dream
let him go out into the world and search for the tree of the sun
let him pluck a golden apple from it and bring it home
when the king and queen had each related their dreams to the other
they were much amazed that they should both have dreamt exactly the same about their son
this is clearly a sign from heaven that we should send our son out into the world in order that he may come home the great sunhero
the king at once bade his son set forth in search of the tree of the sun
for a long time he wandered all through the world
it was not till the ninetyninth day after he started that he found an old man who was able to tell him where the tree of the sun grew
after another ninetynine days he arrived at a golden castle
when he reached the tree he put out his hand to pick a golden apple but all of a sudden the tree grew higher
who addressed him in these words do you really imagine
that you can pluck an apple so easily from the tree of the sun
you must guard the tree for nine days and nine nights from the ravages of two wild black wolves
i will guard the tree of the sun nine days and nine nights
if you do not succeed the sun will kill you
with these words the red girl went back into the golden castle
she had hardly left him when the two black wolves appeared but the sunhero beat them off with his sword
but he had hardly sat down to rest when the two black wolves were on the scene again
turned to the sunhero and said in a human voice listen to what i am going to say
a fairy gave me to your mother in order that i might be of service to you so let me tell you
that if you go to sleep and let the wolves harm the tree
which prevents their obeying the sun's command to take your life
who will certainly kill you if you fall asleep and let the wolves damage the tree
then the sunhero strove with all his might and kept the black wolves at bay
conquered his desire to sleep but on the eighth night his strength failed him
when he awoke a woman in black stood beside him
for you have let the two black wolves damage the tree of the sun
i command you to ride away from here at once
for you proudly let yourself be called the sunhero without having done anything to deserve the name
only to his mother did he confide what had befallen him
after a time the prince forgot all about his adventure
but one day when he was out hunting he felt very thirsty
coming to a stream he stooped down to drink from it
as he lay on his deathbed the black woman appeared and said so the sun has
a similar fate will overtake everyone under the sun who wrongfully assumes a title to which he has no right
once upon a time there was a peasant whose wife died
leaving him with two children twins a boy and a girl
for some years the poor man lived on alone with the children
caring for them as best he could but everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it
at last he made up his mind to marry again
feeling that a wife would bring peace and order to his household and take care of his motherless children
in the following years several children were born to him but peace and order did not come to the household
constantly drove them out of the house for her one idea was to get them out of the way
all day she thought of nothing but how she should get rid of them and at last an evil idea came into her head
she determined to send them out into the great gloomy wood where a wicked witch lived
saying you have been such good children that i am going to send you to visit my granny
who lives in a dear little hut in the wood
you will have to wait upon her and serve her
so the children left the house together and the little sister
said to the brother we will first go and see our own dear grandmother
how i pity you and yet i can do nothing to help you
but to a wicked witch who lives in that great gloomy wood
she gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of ham and a loaf of bread
when they reached it they saw in front of them
with one foot in one corner and the other in the other corner
though they were so terrified that they hid behind one another
granny our stepmother has sent us to wait upon you
ill put you in a pan and fry you in the oven that's what ill do with you
she gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well
from every hole and corner in the hut mice came pattering along the floor
the girl gave them the bread that her grandmother had given her
then the mice told her that the witch had a cat
the cat was very fond of ham if she would give the cat her ham
it would show her the way out of the wood
in the meantime they would spin the yarn for her
so the girl set out to look for the cat
in great trouble because he could not carry water from the well in a sieve
as it came pouring out as fast as he put it in
as she was trying to comfort him they heard a rustling of wings
a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them
for youll find that water will stay in the sieve
when they had eaten the last crumb they told the boy to fill up the holes of the sieve with clay
carried the sieve full of water into the hut without spilling a drop
when they entered the hut the cat was curled up on the floor
tell us how we are to get away from the witch
all they had to do was to throw the handkerchief on the ground and run as fast as they could
as soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep
they must throw the comb behind them and run for their lives
for where the comb fell a dense forest would start up
which would delay the witch so long that they would be able to get safely away
the cat had scarcely finished speaking when the witch returned to see if the children had fulfilled their tasks
she grumbled but tomorrow youll have something more difficult to do
the poor children lay down to sleep on a heap of straw in the corner of the hut but they dared not close their eyes
in the morning the witch gave the girl two pieces of linen to weave before night
the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips
as soon as she had gone out of sight the children took the comb and the handkerchief
who was going to leap on them and tear them to pieces but they threw the remains of their bread to him
but the little sister tied the twigs together with a piece of ribbon
in the meantime in the hut the cat was busy weaving the linen and tangling the threads as it wove
the witch returned to see how the children were getting on and she crept up to the window
when the witch saw that the children had escaped her
she said why did you let the children leave the hut
but the cat curled up its tail and put its back up
answered i have served you all these years and you never even threw me a bone
but the dear children gave me their own piece of ham
then the witch was furious with the watchdog and with the birchtrees
but the dog answered i have served you all these years and you never gave me so much as a hard crust
but the dear children gave me their own loaf of bread
said i have served you longer than i can say
you never tied a bit of twine even round my branches and the dear children bound them up with their brightest ribbons
so the witch saw there was no help to be got from her old servants
that the best thing she could do was to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the children
as the children ran they heard the sound of the broom sweeping the ground close behind them
so instantly they threw the handkerchief down over their shoulder
it took her a long time before she found a place which she could ford over on her broomstick but at last she got across
heard the broom sweeping the earth close behind them so
in which the roots and branches were so closely intertwined
that it was impossible to force a way through it
so when the witch came up to it on her broom she found that there was nothing for it but to turn round and go back to her hut
but the twins ran straight on till they reached their own home
then they told their father all that they had suffered
he was so angry with their stepmother that he drove her out of the house
never let her return but he and the children lived happily together and he took care of them himself
there was once upon a time a couple who had no children
they prayed heaven every day to send them a child
at last heaven heard their prayer and sent them a child exactly the size of a hazelnut
their tiny son too was as clever as he could be
so sharp and sensible that all the neighbours marvelled over the wise things he said and did
was sitting one day in an eggshell on the table beside his mother
your little feet would take an hour to go the distance an ordinary person could do in a minute
just send me a message and youll see that i shall be back in next to no time
the hazelnut child jumped quickly out of the eggshell and ran out into the street
here he found a man on horseback who was just setting out for the neighbouring village
then began to pinch the horse and to prick it with a pin
the horse plunged and reared and then set off at a hard gallop
which it continued in spite of its rider's efforts to stop it
the poor tired creature pursued its way at a snail's pace
crept down the horse's leg then he ran to his aunt and asked her for a comb
when he handed his mother the comb that his aunt had given him
but how did you manage to get back so quickly
you see i was quite right when i said i knew a messenger was the profession for me
his father too possessed a horse which he often used to take out into the fields to graze
at midday the father turned to his small son and said
i must go home and give your mother a message
a robber passed by and saw the horse grazing without any one watching it
for of course he could not see the hazelnut child hidden in the grass
climbed up the horse's tail and began to bite it on the back
enraging the creature to such an extent that it paid no attention to the direction the robber tried to make it go in
the father was much astonished when he saw a stranger riding his horse
but the hazelnut child climbed down quickly and told him all that had happened
his father had the robber arrested at once and put into prison
one autumn when the hazelnut child was twenty years old he said to his parents farewell
as soon as i have become rich i will return home to you
in the evening the hazelnut child crept on to the roof
he climbed on to the back of the fatherstork and bound a silk cord round the joint of one of its wings
then he crept among its soft downy feathers and fell asleep
the hazelnut child flew through the air on the stork's back
when he wanted to rest he bound his silk cord on to the joint of the bird's other wing
in this way he reached the country of the black people
where the storks took up their abode close to the capital
when the people saw the hazelnut child they were much astonished
took him with the stork to the king of the country
the king was delighted with the little creature and kept him always beside him
he soon grew so fond of the little man that he gave him a diamond four times as big as himself
the hazelnut child fastened the diamond firmly under the stork's neck with a ribbon
when he saw that the other storks were getting ready for their northern flight
for he himself was not able to lift the great diamond
so the hazelnut child and his parents lived in happiness and prosperity after this till they died
the story of big klaus and little klaus in a certain village there lived two people who had both the same name
but one owned four horses and the other only one
the one who had four horses was called big klaus
the whole week through little klaus had to plough for big klaus
lend him his one horse then big klaus lent him his four horses
how loudly little klaus cracked his whip over all the five horses
for they were indeed as good as his on this one day
all the bells in the churchtowers were pealing the people were dressed in their best clothes
they saw little klaus ploughing with the five horses but he was so happy that he kept on cracking his whip
but as soon as someone else was going by little klaus forgot that he must not say it
for if you say it once more i will give your horse such a crack on the head that it will drop down dead on the spot
he became so happy in thinking how well it looked to have five horses ploughing his field that
he struck little klaus one horse such a blow on the head that it fell down and died on the spot
before he could get on to the right road night came on
i should very much like to be allowed to spend the night there
thought little klaus and he went and knocked at the door
but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away her husband was not at home
said little klaus and the farmer's wife shut the door in his face
looking at the roof it will make a splendid bed
if only the stork won't fly down and bite my legs
the wooden shutters over the windows were not shut at the top
spread with wine and roast meat and a beautiful fish
the farmer's wife and the sexton sat at the table
while he stuck his fork into the fish which was his favourite dish
then he heard someone riding along the road towards the house
he was a very worthy man but he had one great peculiarity namely
that was why the sexton had gone to say goodday to the farmer's wife when he knew that her husband was not at home
the good woman therefore put in front of him the best food she had
but when they heard the farmer coming they were frightened
the farmer's wife begged the sexton to creep into a great empty chest
as he knew the poor man could not bear to see a sexton
the wife hastily hid all the beautiful food and the wine in her oven for if her husband had seen it
he would have been sure to ask what it all meant
then little klaus told him how he had lost his way
said the farmer but we must first have something to eat
under the table at his feet he had laid the sack with the horseskin in it
at the same time treading on it again so that it squeaked even louder than before
for he has conjured the whole oven full of roast meats and fish and cakes
said the farmer and opening the oven he saw all the delicious
but which he now believed the wizard in the sack had conjured up for them
but she put the food at once on the table
that he has also conjured up for us three bottles of wine they are standing in the corner by the oven
the wife had to fetch the wine which she had hidden
he would very much like to have had such a wizard as little klaus had in the sack
said little klaus my wizard can do everything that i ask
he says yes but that the devil looks so ugly that we should not like to see him
he will show himself in the shape of a sexton
you must know that i can't bear to look at a sexton
treading on the sack and putting his ear to it
he says you can open the chest in the corner there
you will see the devil squatting inside it but you must hold the lid so that he shall not escape
going towards the chest where his wife had hidden the real sexton
now i have seen him he looked just like our sexton
i will pay you down a bushelful of money on the spot
just think how many things i can get from this wizard
as you have been so good as to give me shelter tonight
you shall have the wizard for a bushel of money
little klaus gave the farmer his sack with the dry skin
the farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow to carry away his money and the chest
said little klaus and away he went with his money and the big chest
on the other side of the wood was a large deep river
the water flowed so rapidly that you could scarcely swim against the stream
it is as heavy as if it were filled with stones
dragging it along i will throw it into the river
then he took the chest with one hand and lifted it up a little
as if he were going to throw it into the water
i must throw him quickly into the water to drown him
i will give you a whole bushelful of money if you will let me go
pushed the empty chest into the water and went to his house
said he to himself when he shook all his money out in a heap in his room
this will put big klaus in a rage when he hears how rich i have become through my one horse but i won't tell him just yet
so he sent a boy to big klaus to borrow a bushel measure from him
thought big klaus and he smeared some tar at the bottom
so that of whatever was measured a little should remain in it
this is just what happened for when he got his measure back
all the shoemakers and tanners came running to ask him what he wanted for them
they said and the shoemakers seized their yard measures and the tanners their leathern aprons and they gave big klaus a good beating
they shouted and big klaus had to hurry off as quickly as he could
he took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to try if he could not bring her back to life
while he sat in the corner and slept on a chair
in the night as he sat there the door opened
going up to it he struck the grandmother on the head just where he thought little klaus would be
it was a good thing for my grandmother that she was dead already
sat his grandmother on the back seat so that she could not fall out when he drove
when the sun rose they were in front of a large inn
she is sitting outside in the cart i can not bring her in
but she never moved in her place and at last he grew angry
will bury your grandmother as if she were my own only don't tell about it
the host buried his grandmother as if she had been his own
now when little klaus again reached home with so much money he sent his boy to big klaus to borrow his bushel measure
so he went himself to little klaus with the measure
i killed her in order to get a bushel of money
he began to tell him what a dreadful thing he had done
that he ought to be punished till big klaus was so frightened that he jumped into the cart and drove home as hard as he could
the apothecary and all the people thought he must be mad
so as soon as he got home he took the largest sack he could find
went to little klaus and said you have fooled me again
it is all your fault but you shan' t do it again
he had to go a long way before he came to the river
the road passed by the church the organ was sounding
big klaus put down the sack with little klaus in it by the churchdoor
thought that he might as well go in and hear a psalm before going on farther
with snowwhite hair and a long staff in his hand
these pushed against the sack so that it was overturned
i am so old and yet i can not die
called out little klaus creep in here instead of me
which little klaus fastened up and then went on with the cows and oxen
taking up the sack on his shoulders it seemed to him as if it had become lighter for the old cattledriver was not half as heavy as little klaus
that must be because i heard part of the service
for he thought little klaus was inside down you go
then he went home but when he came to the crossroads
replied little klaus you threw me into the river a good halfhour ago
because now i am on dry land and really rich
how frightened i was when i was in the sack
how the wind whistled in my ears as you threw me from the bridge into the cold water
i sank at once to the bottom but i did not hurt myself for underneath was growing the most beautiful soft grass
immediately the sack opened the loveliest maiden in snowwhite garments
a mile farther down the road there is another herd
now i saw that the river was a great highroad for the seapeople
along it they travel underneath from the sea to the land till the river ends
full of flowers and fresh grass the fishes which were swimming in the water shot past my ears as the birds do here in the air
what fine cattle were grazing in the ditches and dykes
that the seamaiden said to me a mile farther along the road and by the road she meant the river
for she can go by no other way there was another herd of cattle waiting for me
therefore it makes it much shorter if one comes on the land and drives across the field to the river
do you think i should also get some cattle if i went to the bottom of the river
but i can't carry you in a sack to the river you are too heavy for me
if you like to go there yourself and then creep into the sack
i will throw you in with the greatest of pleasure
said big klaus but if i don't get any seacattle when i come there
which was lying on the back of one of the oxen
for i am afraid i may not reach the bottom
said little klaus but still he laid a big stone in the sack
once upon a time there was a king and his queen in their kingdom
he was less fond of adventures than men of rank usually were in those days
one fine winter day he rode into the forest along with his men to enjoy himself
until they caught sight of a hind with a gold ring on its horns
so they gave chase and rode on without stopping until all the horses began to founder beneath them
then there came over them a darkness so black that they could no longer see the hind
by this time they were far away from any house
thought it was high time to be making their way home again
but soon each began to think that he knew the right way best so they separated
wandered on for a time until he came to a little clearing in the forest not far from the sea
where he saw a woman sitting on a chair and a big barrel standing beside her
the prince went up to her and saluted her politely
saw lying at the bottom an unusually beautiful gold ring
which pleased him so much that he could not take his eyes off it
said that he might have it if he would take the trouble to get it for which the prince thanked her
thought he would easily reach the ring but the more he stretched down after it the deeper grew the barrel
as he was thus bending down into it the woman suddenly rose up and pushed him in head first
saying that now he could take up his quarters there
then she fixed the top on the barrel and threw it out into the sea
as he felt the barrel floating out from the land and tossing about on the waves
how many days he spent thus he could not tell
but at last he felt that the barrel was knocking against rocks
thinking it was probably land and not merely a reef in the sea
he at last made up his mind to kick the bottom out of the barrel
having done so he was able to get on shore
for the rocks by the sea were smooth and level but overhead there were high cliffs
but he went along the foot of them for a little
he looked round about him and saw that he was on an island
he one day heard a great noise in the forest
so that he ran to hide himself among the trees
so that he could see nothing for it but to lie down just where he was
he stood still and looked at the prince for a little then he took him up in his arms and carried him home to his house
she could have it to help her in the house
one day the giant took him round and showed him all his rooms except the parlour this made the prince curious to have a look into it
then he saw that some living creature moved inside and ran along the floor towards him and said something
which made him so frightened that he sprang back from the door and shut it again
as soon as the fright began to pass off he tried it again
for he thought it would be interesting to hear what it said but things went just as before with him
thinking with himself that it was no great treasure after all but all the same what it had said to him stuck in his mind
it is not said how long the prince stayed with the giant
but one day the latter came to him and said he would now take him over to the mainland out of the island
said there was no need to pay him for his services
they were so little worth but if he did wish to give him anything he would choose what was in the parlour
you chose my old woman's right hand but i must not break my word
which came running with signs of great delight but the prince was so much afraid of it that it was all he could do to keep from showing his alarm
after this the giant accompanied him down to the sea
where he saw a stone boat which was just big enough to hold the two of them and the dog
on reaching the mainland the giant took a friendly farewell of ring
told him he might take possession of all that was in the island after he and his wife died
the prince thanked him for this and for all his other kindnesses
while ring went up some distance from the sea but he did not know what land he had come to
after he had walked on in silence for a time the dog spoke to him and said you don't seem to have much curiosity
you must ask the king to keep us all winter
to give you a little room for both of us
the prince now began to be less afraid of the dog
they came to the king and asked him to keep them all the winter
when the king's men saw the dog they began to laugh at it
make as if they would tease it but when the prince saw this he advised them not to do it
they replied that they didn't care a bit what he thought
after ring had been with the king for some days the latter began to think there was a great deal in him
who became very jealous when he saw how much the king esteemed ring and one day he talked to him
said he could not understand why he had so good an opinion of this stranger
who had not yet shown himself superior to other men in anything
the king replied that it was only a short time since he had come there
red then asked him to send them both to cut down wood next morning
so that he might have one in reserve if the first one got broken
next morning the king asked ring and red to go and cut down trees for him
each went his own way but when the prince had got out into the wood snati took one of the axes and began to hew along with him
in the evening the king came to look over their day's work
found that ring's woodheap was more than twice as big
that ring was not quite useless never have i seen such a day's work
ring was now in far greater esteem with the king than before
i think you might ask him to kill the wild oxen in the wood here
bring you the horns and the hides in the evening
no one has ever yet ventured to go against them
red answered that he had only one life to lose
it would be interesting to see how brave he was besides
the king would have good reason to ennoble him if he overcame them
one day asked ring to go and kill the oxen that were in the wood for him
bring their horns and hides to him in the evening
as soon as ring came in sight of the oxen they came bellowing to meet him one of them was tremendously big
if it is to go well you will go against the little one
meanwhile the prince went against the other with fear and trembling
by the time snati came to help him the ox had nearly got him under
but snati was not slow in helping his master to kill it
each of them then began to flay their own ox
but ring was only half through by the time snati had finished his
the prince thought himself unfit to carry all the horns and both the hides
so snati told him to lay them all on his back until they got to the palace gate
laid everything on the dog except the skin of the smaller ox
there handed over to him the hides and horns of the oxen
held him to be a great hero nor could red any longer say anything against him
he came to the king and said he had something to say to him
red said that he had just remembered the gold cloak
bright gold piece that the king had lost about a year before
since ring was such a mighty man that he could do everything
it had occurred to him to advise the king to ask him to search for these treasures
come back with them before christmas in return the king should promise him his daughter
the king replied that he thought it altogether unbecoming to propose such a thing to ring
seeing that he could not tell him where the things were but red pretended not to hear the king's excuses
went on talking about it until the king gave in to him
saying that he wished to ask a great favour of him
said the king that you find for me my gold cloak
if you can bring them to me before christmas i will give you my daughter in marriage
for he saw he was in a great difficulty but
he thought it was excellent to have such a chance of winning the king's daughter
said to him that he should not disregard what the king had asked him to do but he would have to act upon his advice
now you must first of all go about the neighbourhood
gathered so much salt that he could hardly carry it but snati said
until they came to the foot of a steep cliff
said snati and in this way he pulled ring up on the lowest shelf of the rock
but snati made a third effort and reached the top of the cliff
now you must empty all the salt into the porridgepot
i got the milk by witchcraft yesterday out of four kingdoms
but after they had finished it the old hag grew so thirsty that she could stand it no longer
asked her daughter to go out and bring her some water from the river that ran near by
the girl took the gold and ran out with it
it was so bright that it shone all over the plain
as soon as she came to the river she lay down to take a drink of the water
but meanwhile the two of them had got down off the roof and thrust her
the old hag began now to long for the water
said that the girl would be running about with the gold piece all over the plain
so she asked her son to go and get her a drop of water
when he came outside it shone so bright that he could see to go with it
on reaching the river he went to take a drink like his sister
but at that moment ring and snati sprang upon him
asked her husband to go for a drink for her the brats
the old troll now went out with the gold chessboard
they saw the poor old fellow's ghost come marching up from the river
after a hard struggle they mastered him a second time
when they got back again to the window they saw that the old hag was moving towards the door
for if she once gets out we shall have no chance with her
one of us must pour boiling porridge out of the pot on her
no sooner did the hag see them than she said
prince ring you must have seen to my husband and children
sprang at her with a redhot iron from the fire
while ring kept pouring boiling porridge on her without stopping
then they burned the old troll and her to ashes
the most valuable of these they carried with them as far as the cliff
then they hastened home to the king with his three treasures
was astonished at how clever a man ring was in all kinds of feats
so that he esteemed him still more highly than before
betrothed his daughter to him and the feast for this was to last all through christmastide
ring thanked the king courteously for this and all his other kindnesses
as soon as he had finished eating and drinking in the hall went off to sleep in his own room
asked permission to sleep in the prince's bed for that night
while the prince should sleep where the dog usually lay
that he deserved more from him than that came to
but to take care not to meddle with anything that was in the bed
who came into the hall and showed the king his right arm wanting the hand
said that now he could see what kind of a man his intended soninlaw was
for he had done this to him without any cause whatever
said he would soon find out the truth about it
if ring had cut off his hand without good cause he should be hanged but if it was otherwise
so the king sent for ring and asked him for what reason he had done this
had just told ring what had happened during the night
in reply he asked the king to go with him and he would show him something
saw lying on the bed a man's hand holding a sword
the king answered that in that case he could not blame him for protecting his own life
the first night that they went to bed together snati asked ring to allow him to lie at their feet
during the night he heard a howling and outcry beside them
struck a light in a hurry and saw an ugly dog's skin lying near him
the bridegroom then asked his name he replied that he was called ring
who had laid a spell on him that he should turn into a dog
never be released from the spell unless a prince of the same name as himself allowed him to sleep at his feet the first night after his marriage
as soon as she knew that you were my namesake she tried to get you destroyed
so that you might not free me from the spell
she was the hind that you and your companions chased she was the woman that you found in the clearing with the barrel
the old hag that we just now killed in the cave
went to the cliff and brought all the treasure home to the palace
then they went to the island and removed all that was valuable from it
his sister ingiborg and his father's kingdom to look after
had half the kingdom while he lived and the whole of it after his death
now it was certainly a little audacious of him to venture to say to the emperor's daughter
there were hundreds of princesses who would gladly have said yes
on the grave of the prince's father grew a rosetree
its scent was so sweet that when you smelt it you forgot all your cares and troubles
he had also a nightingale which could sing as if all the beautiful melodies in the world were shut up in its little throat
this rose and this nightingale the princess was to have
so they were both put into silver caskets and sent to her
the emperor had them brought to him in the great hall
where the princess was playing here comes a duke ariding with her ladiesinwaiting
when she caught sight of the big caskets which contained the presents
let us see first what is in the other casket before we begin to be angry
it sang so beautifully that one could scarcely utter a cross word against it
how much the bird reminds me of the musical snuffbox of the late empress
said the emperor and then he wept like a little child
said the princess and she would not on any account allow the prince to come
can i get a place here as servant in the castle
but there are so many who ask for a place that i don't know whether there will be one for you but
it has just occurred to me that i want someone to look after the swine
he had a wretched little room close to the pigsties here he had to stay
when evening was come he had made a pretty little pot
when the pot boiled they jingled most beautifully and played the old tune where is augustus dear
that when one held one's finger in the steam of the pot
then at once one could smell what dinner was ready in any fireplace in the town
now the princess came walking past with all her ladiesinwaiting
when she heard the tune she stood still and her face beamed with joy
one of the ladiesinwaiting had to go down but she put on wooden clogs
but she had only gone a few steps when the bells rang out so prettily where is augustus dear
ask him whether he will take ten kisses from my ladiesinwaiting
the ladiesinwaiting placed themselves in front and then spread out their dresses so the swineherd got his ten kisses
whether it was at the chancellor's or at the shoemaker's
we know who is going to have soup and pancakes we know who is going to have porridge and sausages isn't it interesting
polkas which had ever been known since the world began
go down and ask him what this instrument costs but i won't kiss him again
said the ladyinwaiting who had gone down to ask him
then she went on but she had only gone a few steps when she stopped
ten kisses the rest he can take from my ladiesinwaiting
but we don't at all like being kissed by him
so the ladiesinwaiting had to go down to him again
she said then and so all the ladiesinwaiting put themselves in front
why those are the ladiesinwaiting playing their games i must go down to them
which were shoes though he had trodden them down into slippers
as soon as he came into the yard he walked very softly
the ladiesinwaiting were so busy counting the kisses and seeing fair play that they never noticed the emperor
when he saw the kissing and then he threw one of his slippers at their heads just as the swineherd was taking his eightysixth kiss
the princess and the swineherd were driven out of the empire
then she stood still and wept the swineherd was scolding
looking so beautiful that the princess was obliged to courtesy
you would have nothing to do with a noble prince you did not understand the rose or the nightingale
but you could kiss the swineherd for the sake of a toy
he went into his kingdom and shut the door in her face
she had to stay outside singing where's my augustus dear
how to tell a true princess there was once upon a time a prince who wanted to marry a princess
so he travelled through the whole world to find one
but he could not find out if they were true princesses
for he had wanted very much to have a true princess
one night there was a dreadful storm it thundered and lightened and the rain streamed down in torrents
in what a sad plight she was from the rain and the storm
the water was running down from her hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heels again
then she put twenty mattresses on top of the pea
this was the bed in which the princess was to sleep
the next morning she was asked how she had slept
i am sure i don't know what was in the bed
i laid on something so hard that my whole body is black and blue
because she had felt the pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eiderdown quilts
no one but a true princess could be so sensitive
for now he knew that at last he had got hold of a true princess
where it is still to be seen if no one has stolen it
the blue mountains there were once a scotsman and an englishman and an irishman serving in the army together
who took it into their heads to run away on the first opportunity they could get
they went on travelling for two days through a great forest
every night they had to climb up into the trees through fear of the wild beasts that were in the wood
on the second morning the scotsman saw from the top of his tree a great castle far away
he said to himself that he would certainly die if he stayed in the forest without anything to eat but the roots of grass
as he got down out of the tree he set off towards the castle
so that it was quite late when he reached the castle
to his great disappointment found nothing but closed doors and no smoke rising from the chimneys
he thought there was nothing for it but to die after all
when he heard a window being opened high above him
saw the most beautiful woman he had ever set eyes on
after that showed him to the room where the others were
he lay down on one of the beds and fell sound asleep
now we must go back to the two that he left behind him in the wood
when nightfall and the time of the wild beasts came upon these
off he went without saying a word to the irishman
everything happened to him just as it had done to the scotsman
when night came he climbed up into the same tree as the englishman had been on the night before
as soon as day came he also saw the castle
set out towards it but when he reached it he could see no signs of fire or living being about it
he asked if she would give him food and drink
she set before him food and drink that he had never seen the like of before
with diamond rings hanging at every loop of the curtains
everything that was in the room besides astonished him so much that he actually forgot that he was hungry
when she saw that he was not eating at all
to which he replied that he would neither eat nor drink until he knew who she was
my father has promised that the man who releases me from the spell shall have the third of his kingdom while he is alive
if ever i saw a man who looked likely to do this
no one who ever came to the castle has asked me who i was
what is the spell that has been laid on you
if i could get a man to stay in it from ten o'clock till midnight for three nights on end i should be freed from the spell
said he i will take on hand to do it
he went into the room but before long he heard a hammering and knocking on the outside of the door
knelt on his body till it came to midnight but as soon as the cock crew they all disappeared
the irishman was little more than alive by this time
rubbed him from head to foot with something from it
thereupon he was as sound as ever but after what he had got that night he was very unwilling to try it a second time
saying that the next night would not be so bad
when it was getting near midnight he heard them ordering him to open the door
there were three of them for every one that there had been the previous evening
he did not make the slightest movement to go out to them or to open the door
when day came the princess went to the room to see if he was still alive
the first thing he said then was that he was a fool to go on getting himself killed for anyone he ever saw
was determined to be off and stay there no longer
when the princess learned his intention she entreated him to stay
reminding him that another night would free her from the spell
if there is a single spark of life in you when the day comes
the stuff that is in this bottle will make you as sound as ever you were
with all this the irishman decided to stay but that night there were three at him for every one that was there the two nights before
it looked very unlikely that he would be alive in the morning after all that he got
the princess came to see if he was still alive
she found him lying on the floor as if dead
she tried to see if there was breath in him
accordingly she poured what was in the bottle on him
the princess then told the irishman that she must go away for the present
but would return for him in a few days in a carriage drawn by four grey horses
i have paid dear for you for the last three nights
if i have to part with you now but in the twinkling of an eye she had disappeared
he did not know what to do with himself when he saw that she was gone
but before she went she had given him a little rod
he went in and stretched himself on three chairs that were in the room
when what does he see coming in at the door but a little fairhaired lad
answered the lad the princess that was under the spell and is now free
by this the irishman knew that she had sent the lad to wait on him
the lad also told him that his mistress wished him to be ready next morning at nine o'clock
went out into the garden but the little fairhaired lad took a big pin out of his pocket
stuck it into the back of the irishman's coat without his noticing it
before long the princess came with the carriage and four horses
when the night is not long enough for him to sleep
tell him that if he doesn't meet me at this time tomorrow it is not likely that he will ever see me again all his life
as soon as she was gone the lad took the pin out of his master's coat
she bade me tell you that if you don't meet her at nine o'clock tomorrow you will never see her again
could not understand why the sleep should have fallen upon him just when she was coming
when it was getting near nine o'clock he went out to the garden to wait till she came
precisely at nine o'clock came the princess in the carriage with four horses
asked the lad if his master had got up yet but he said no
was the sleep he had last night not enough for him
tell him that he will never see me here again and here is a sword that you will give him in my name
as soon as she had gone the lad took the pin out of his master's coat
the irishman was ready to kill the lad out of sheer vexation
but when he gave a glance over his shoulder not a trace of the fairhaired lad was left
he thought of going into the room where all the men were lying asleep
there among the rest he found his two comrades who had deserted along with him
he gave them as much silver and gold as they could carry when they went away
there was plenty to do before he got all the others wakened
for the two doors of the castle were crowded with them all the day long
till finally he thought he would go about the world to see if he could find anyone to give him news of her
so he took the best horse in the stable and set out
but could find no one able to tell him anything of the princess
at last he fell into so great despair that he thought he would put an end to his own life
thinking that he would go on in hope of meeting some one who could tell him where the blue mountains were
after he had gone a long way without thinking where he was going
on reaching it he found it came from a little house
as soon as the man inside heard the noise of the horse's feet he came out to see who was there
he asked what brought him there and where he was going
all that time i have not seen a single human being but yourself
i have been going about for the last three years
to see if i could find anyone who can tell me where the blue mountains are
i have a book which contains the history of the world
if there is such a place as the blue mountains in it we shall find it out
the old man said he had not gone to sleep all night for going through the book
but there was not a word about the blue mountains in it
if there is such a place on earth at all
i have a brother who lives nine hundred miles from here
the irishman answered that he could never go these nine hundred miles
said the old man i can do better than that
i have only to blow my whistle and you will be at my brother's house before nightfall
the irishman did not know where on earth he was until he found himself at the other old man's door
who also told him that it was three hundred years since he had seen anyone
i am going to see if i can find anyone that can tell me where the blue mountains are
i have a book of the history of the world
if there is such a place in it at all
but there was not a word in the book about the blue mountains
the old man told him that he had a brother nine hundred miles away
that if information could be got about them from anyone it would be from him and i will enable you
when the old man saw him he said he had not seen a single man for three hundred years
was very much surprised to see anyone come to him now
i never heard the name before but if they do exist i shall find them out
i am master of all the birds in the world
have only to blow my whistle and every one will come to me
i shall then ask each of them to tell where it came from
if there is any way of finding out the blue mountains that is it
when he blew it then all the birds of the world began to gather
the old man questioned each of them as to where they had come from
but there was not one of them that had come from the blue mountains
she said i had more than twenty times further to come than any bird that has come here today
said the old man and what are they doing there
for the marriage of the daughter of the king of the blue mountains
for three years now she has refused to marry anyone whatsoever
until she should give up all hope of the coming of the man who released her from the spell
for three years is the time that she agreed with her father to remain without marrying
the irishman knew that it was for himself she had been waiting so long
but he was unable to make any better of it
for he had no hope of reaching the blue mountains all his life
asked the eagle what she would take for carrying this man on her back to the blue mountains
every time i look over my shoulder he must throw one of them into my mouth
as soon as the irishman and the old man heard her demand they went out hunting
till they would get it all heaped up on her back
to enable them to get on to the eagle's back
there they piled up the meat as well as they could
to remember to throw a quarter of beef to her every time she looked round
the old man gave the eagle the word to be off
which she instantly obeyed and every time she turned her head the irishman threw a quarter of beef into her mouth
as they came near the borders of the kingdom of the blue mountains
what was the irishman at but throwing the stone between her tail and her neck
where he fell into the bay that was right in front of the king's palace
fortunately the points of his toes just touched the bottom
when he went up into the town all the streets were gleaming with light
the wedding of the princess was just about to begin
this happened to be the house of the king's henwife
he asked the old woman what was causing all the noise and light in the town
for she has been expecting every day that the man who freed her from the spell would come
had a great wedding that lasted for a year and a day
the tinderbox a soldier came marching along the high road left
he had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side
for he had been to the wars and was now returning home
she was very ugly to look at her underlip hung down to her breast
you ought to have as much money as you would like to carry
then you will see a hole through which you can let yourself down into the tree
so that i may be able to pull you up again when you call
when you reach the bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall it is light there
which you can open the keys are in the locks
you will see a great chest in the middle of the floor with a dog sitting upon it he has eyes as large as saucers
then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it open the chest and take as much money as you like
where there is a dog with eyes as large as millwheels
but don't take any notice of him just set him upon my apron
but the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the round tower at copenhagen
i can tell you but you needn't be afraid of him either
put him on my apron and he won't touch you
you can take out of the chest as much gold as you like
old witch for surely you are not going to do this for nothing
for me you shall bring nothing but an old tinderbox which my grandmother forgot last time she was down there
there sat the dog with eyes as big as saucers glaring at him
took as much copper as his pockets could hold then he shut the chest
sure enough there sat the dog with eyes as large as millwheels
for he had never seen a dog like this before
with all that he could buy up the whole town
now he threw away all the silver with which he had filled his pockets and knapsack
then called up through the tree now pull me up again
tell me at once what you want to do with it
but he tied up all his gold in her apron
ordered the best chamber and his favourite dinner for now that he had so much money he was really rich
it certainly occurred to the servant who had to clean his boots that they were astonishingly old boots for such a rich lord
but that was because he had not yet bought new ones next day he appeared in respectable boots and fine clothes
instead of a common soldier he had become a noble lord
the people told him about all the grand doings of the town and the king
they told him she lives in a great copper castle
no one except the king may go in or out
for it is prophesied that she will marry a common soldier
which was very nice of him he had experienced in former times how hard it is not to have a farthing in the world
at last the day came when he had nothing left but two shillings
he had to leave the beautiful rooms in which he had been living
but all at once it flashed across him that there was a little end of tinder in the tinderbox
which he had taken from the hollow tree into which the witch had helped him down
he found the box with the tinder in it but just as he was kindling a light
stood before him and said what does my lord command
holding a great purse full of money in his mouth
now the soldier knew what a capital tinderbox this was
the dog that sat on the chest of copper appeared if he rubbed twice
there came the dog that watched over the silver chest and if he rubbed three times
one day he thought to himself it is very strange that no one can get to see the princess
but what's the use of that if she has to sit for ever in the great copper castle with all the towers
there came the dog with eyes as large as saucers
said the soldier but i should very much like to see the princess for a moment
was so beautiful that anyone could see she was a real princess
the soldier really could not refrain from kissing her he was such a thorough soldier
the princess said that the night before she had had such a strange dream about a dog and a soldier she had ridden on the dog's back
but the next night one of the ladiesinwaiting was to watch at the princess's bed
the soldier had an overpowering longing to see the princess again
so the dog came in the middle of the night and fetched her
but the ladyinwaiting slipped on indiarubber shoes and followed them
she thought to herself now i know where it is and made a great cross on the door with a piece of chalk
but when he saw that a cross had been made on the door of the house where the soldier lived
made crosses on all the doors in the town and that was very clever
for now the ladyinwaiting could not find the right house
officers came out to see where the princess had been
when he saw the first door with a cross on it
they all exclaimed wherever they looked there was a cross on the door
then they realised that the sign would not help them at all
who could do a great deal more than just drive in a coach
so that the grains would strew the whole road wherever the princess went
took the princess on his back and ran away with her to the soldier
so that he might have had her for his wife
the dog did not notice how the grains were strewn right from the castle to the soldier's window
in the morning the king and the queen saw plainly where their daughter had been
next morning he could see through the iron grating in front of his little window how the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged
he heard the drums and saw the soldiers marching all the people were running to and fro
with leather apron and shoes he was skipping along so merrily that one of his shoes flew off and fell against the wall
just where the soldier was sitting peeping through the iron grating
but if you will run back to the house where i lived
the shoemaker's boy was very willing to earn four shillings
the king and queen were sitting on a magnificent throne opposite the judges and the whole council
the soldier was already standing on the top of the ladder but when they wanted to put the rope round his neck
he said that the fulfilment of one innocent request was always granted to a poor criminal before he underwent his punishment
he would so much like to smoke a small pipe of tobacco it would be his last pipe in this world
behold i there stood all three dogs the one with eyes as large as saucers
the third with eyes each as large as the round tower of copenhagen
thereupon the dogs fell upon the judges and the whole council
threw them so high into the air that they fell and were smashed into pieces
said the king but the largest dog seized him too
the dogs sat at table and made eyes at everyone
when the king came to be bowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son
said that now it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himself
for he did not know how long he might last now
he would like to see him married before he died
asked his father where he thought it best to look for a wife
the king answered that in a certain country there was a king who had a beautiful daughter
he thought it would be most desirable if sigurd could get her
he came to the king and asked his daughter's hand
but only on the condition that he should remain there as long as he could
for the king himself was not strong and not very able to govern his kingdom
but added that he would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when he heard news of his father's death
who was two years old when word came to sigurd that his father was dead
sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and child
at a time when they needed only one day's voyage to reach home
when most of the others on the ship had fallen asleep
after a time sigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awake
a good while after sigurd had gone below the queen saw something black on the sea
as it approached she could make out that it was a boat
could see the figure of some one sitting in it and rowing it
now the queen saw that it was a stone boat
out of which there came up on board the ship a fearfully ugly witch
could neither speak a word nor move from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors
took the child from her and laid it on the deck then she took the queen
that you slacken not your course until you come to my brother in the underworld
but the boat at once shot away from the ship with her
when the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry
though the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it so she went below to where the king was sleeping with the child on her arm
to leave no one to watch the ship with her
sigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much
for she had never said an angry word to him before but he thought it was quite excusable in this case
for a breeze had sprung up and was blowing straight towards the harbour
they soon reached the land which sigurd was to rule over
found all the people sorrowful for the old king's death
but they became glad when they got sigurd back to the court
hardly ever stopped crying from the time he had been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship
although he had always been such a good child before
so that at last the king had to get a nurse for him one of the maids of the court
as soon as the child got into her charge he stopped crying
after the seavoyage it seemed to the king that the queen had altered very much in many ways
he thought her much more haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used to be
before long others began to notice this as well as the king
one day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talk
put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms
then i am a nice little maiden when i yawn halfway
then i am half a troll and when i yawn fully
in a moment had put on the appearance of a fearfully ugly troll
then there came up through the floor of the room a threeheaded giant with a trough full of meat
who saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her
but did not hear the two of them say anything to each other
they were astonished though at how greedily the queen devoured the meat
were no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at table with the king
as soon as she had finished it the giant disappeared with the trough by the same way as he had come
now we must go back to the king's son after he had been put in charge of the nurse
after she had lit a candle and was holding the child
several planks sprang up in the floor of the room
out at the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white
to which was fastened an iron chain that went down into the ground
pressed it to her breast then she gave it back to the nurse and returned by the same way as she had come
although the woman had not spoken a single word to her
but as the woman was going away she said in a sad tone
the nurse was still more frightened when she heard the woman say this
thought that perhaps some danger was hanging over the child
had behaved towards the child as if it were her own
the most mysterious thing was the woman saying and only one is left but the nurse guessed that this must mean that only one day was left
at last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king
asked him to be present in person next day about the time when the woman usually came
came to the nurse's room a little before the time
sat down on a chair with his drawn sword in his hand
soon after the planks in the floor sprang up as before
the king saw at once that it was his own queen
immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastened to the belt
this was followed by such noises and crashings down in the earth that all the king's palace shook
so that no one expected anything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces
she told him the whole story how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and sent her off in the boat
after she had gone so far that she could not see the ship
she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside a threeheaded giant
but she refused whereupon he shut her up by herself
told her she would never get free until she consented
after a time she began to plan how to get her freedom
at last told him that she would consent if he would allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end
the other end of which he fastened round his own waist
the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his deaththroes
the king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past had been so illtempered
he at once had a sack drawn over her head and made her be stoned to death
the two young fellows also told now what they had heard and seen in the queen's room
for before this they had been afraid to say anything about it
the real queen was now restored to all her dignity
thumbelina there was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny
but she did not know where to get one from
so one day she went to an old witch and said to her i should so much like to have a tiny
little child can you tell me where i can get one
but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field
then she went home and planted the barleycorn immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower
but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud
she kissed the red and yellow petals but as she kissed them the flower burst open
such as one can see any day but in the middle of the blossom
she was scarcely half a thumb in height so they called her thumbelina
but in the daytime she used to play about on the table here the woman had put a bowl
in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal
sailed from one side of the bowl to the other
with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before
an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window
clammy she hopped on to the table where thumbelina lay asleep under the red roseleaf
with slippery and marshy banks here the toad lived with her son
was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnutshell
she might escape us even now she is as light as a feather
we will put her at once on a broad waterlily leaf in the stream
that will be quite an island for her she is so small and light
whilst we are preparing the guestchamber under the marsh where she shall live
which looked as if they were swimming about on the water
to this the old toad swam with thumbelina in her walnutshell
the tiny thumbelina woke up very early in the morning
when she saw where she was she began to cry bitterly for on every side of the great green leaf was water
to make it very grand for her new daughterinlaw then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where thumbelina lay
she wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before thumbelina herself came there
the old toad bowed low in the water before her
then they took the neat little cradle and swam away with it but thumbelina sat alone on the great green leaf and wept
for she did not want to live with the clammy toad
the little fishes swimming about under the water had seen the toad quite plainly
heard what she had said so they put up their heads to see the little girl
they thought her so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live
they assembled in the water round the green stalk which supported the leaf on which she was sitting
the leaf floated farther and farther away thus thumbelina left her native land
it was so beautiful where she was travelling the sun shone on the water and made it sparkle like the brightest silver
tied one end round the butterfly the other end she fastened to the leaf
so that now it glided along with her faster than ever
a great cockchafer came flying past he caught sight of thumbelina
in a moment had put his arms round her slender waist
for he was fastened to the leaf and could not get loose from it
how terrified poor little thumbelina was when the cockchafer flew off with her to the tree
but she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly's account
so that if he could not get away he must starve to death
but the cockchafer did not trouble himself about that he sat down with her on a large green leaf
gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat
all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls they examined thumbelina closely
said all the lady chafers and yet thumbelina was really very pretty
the cockchafer who had stolen her knew this very well but when he heard all the ladies saying she was ugly
would not keep her she might go wherever she liked
so he flew down from the tree with her and put her on a daisy
because she was so ugly that the cockchafer would have nothing to do with her and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable
the whole summer poor little thumbelina lived alone in the great wood
she plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass
so that she was protected from the rain she gathered honey from the flowers for food
all the birds who had sung so sweetly about her had flown away the trees shed their leaves
the flowers died the great cloverleaf under which she had lived curled up
every snowflake that fell on her was to her as a whole shovelful thrown on one of us
but it was torn in the middle and gave her no warmth she was trembling with cold
just outside the wood where she was now living lay a great cornfield
but the corn had been gone a long time only the dry
this made a forest for her to wander about in
all at once she came across the door of a fieldmouse
poor little thumbelina went up to the door and begged for a little piece of barley
for she had not had anything to eat for the last two days
for she was a kindhearted old thing at the bottom
come into my warm room and have some dinner with me
she said as far as i am concerned you may spend the winter with me but you must keep my room clean and tidy
said the fieldmouse my neighbour comes to call on me once a week
you must tell him all the prettiest stories you know
he came and paid them a visit in his blackvelvet coat
his house is twenty times larger than mine he possesses great knowledge
but he can not bear the sun and the beautiful flowers
other songs so prettily that the mole fell in love with her but he did not say anything
but he begged them not to be afraid of the dead bird that lay in the passage it was a real bird with beak and feathers
now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel
the mole took a piece of rotten wood in his mouth
when they came to the place where the dead bird lay
the mole put his broad nose against the ceiling and pushed a hole through
in the middle of the path lay a dead swallow
his claws and head drawn under his feathers the poor bird had evidently died of cold
for she was very fond of all little birds they had sung and twittered so beautifully to her all through the summer
but the mole kicked him with his bandy legs and said now he can't sing any more
it must be very miserable to be a little bird
im thankful that none of my little children are birds always starve in winter
thumbelina did not say anything but when the other two had passed on she bent down to the bird
perhaps it was he that sang to me so prettily in the summer
the mole closed up the hole again which let in the light
but thumbelina could not sleep that night so she got out of bed
so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried
but the bird was not dead he had been frozen
in autumn the swallows fly away to foreign lands but there are some who are late in starting
then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead
she was so frightened for the bird was very large in comparison with herself only an inch high
piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow
fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head
but very weak he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at thumbelina
who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand
then i shall be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine
it is very cold outside it is snowing and freezing
stay in your warm bed i will take care of you
after which he related to her how he had torn one of his wings on a bramble
so that he could not fly as fast as the other swallows
neither the mole nor the fieldmouse learnt anything of this
who opened the hole in the roof for him which the mole had made
the swallow asked her if she would go with him she could sit upon his back
thumbelina wanted very much to fly far away into the green wood
but she knew that the old fieldmouse would be sad if she ran away
thumbelina gazed after him with the tears standing in her eyes
she was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine
the corn which had been sowed in the field over the fieldmouse's home grew up high into the air
what a piece of fortune for a poor child like you
now you must set to work at your linen for your dowry
for nothing must be lacking if you are to become the wife of our neighbour
told her that when the summer was over the sun would not shine so hot now it was burning the earth as hard as a stone
when the breeze parted the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky through them
she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside
but he never came no doubt he had flown away far into the great green wood
or i shall bite you with my sharp white teeth
the mole had come to fetch thumbelina to live with him deep down under the ground
the poor little girl was very sad for now she must say goodbye to the beautiful sun
taking another step outside the house for now the corn had been reaped
put her arms round a little red flower that grew there
give my love to the dear swallow when you see him
she told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole
as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone
i must fly away to warmer lands will you come with me
we will fly far away from the ugly mole and his dark house
to the warm countries where the sun shines more brightly than here
who saved my life when i lay frozen in the dark tunnel
over the great mountains where the snow is always lying
if she was cold she crept under his warm feathers
only keeping her little head out to admire all the beautiful things in the world beneath
at last they came to warm lands there the sun was brighter
in the hedges hung the finest green and purple grapes in the woods grew oranges and lemons the air was scented with myrtle and mint
on the roads were pretty little children running about and playing with great gorgeous butterflies
under the most splendid green trees besides a blue lake stood a glittering whitemarble castle
vines hung about the high pillars there were many swallows nests
in one of these lived the swallow who was carrying thumbelina
but it won't do for you to live with me i am not tidy enough to please you
find a home for yourself in one of the lovely flowers that grow down there now i will set you down
there lay a great white marble column which had fallen to the ground and broken into three pieces
she found a tiny little man sitting in the middle of the flower
as white and transparent as if he were made of glass he had the prettiest golden crown on his head
the most beautiful wings on his shoulders he himself was no bigger than thumbelina
in each blossom there dwelt a tiny man or woman but this one was the king over the others
the little prince was very much frightened at the swallow
for in comparison with one so tiny as himself he seemed a giant
for she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen
so he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers
he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the blackvelvet coat
each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them
but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back
the swallow sat above in his nest and sang the wedding march
that he did as well as he could but he was sad
because he was very fond of thumbelina and did not want to be separated from her
said the spirit of the flower to her that is an ugly name
the story i am going to tell you happened many years ago
but it is worth while for you to listen to it
the emperor's palace was the most splendid in the world
but so brittle and delicate that you had to take great care how you touched it
on the loveliest of them were tied silver bells which tinkled
so that if you passed you could not help looking at the flowers
everything in the emperor's garden was admirably arranged with a view to effect and the garden was so large that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended
you came to a stately forest with great trees and deep lakes in it
large ships could sail under the boughs of the trees
she sang so beautifully that even the poor fisherman who had so much to do stood and listened when he came at night to cast his nets
he said but he had to attend to his work
but when she sang the next night and the fisherman came there again
from all the countries round came travellers to the emperor's town
the travellers told all about it when they went home
but they did not forget the nightingale she was praised the most
all the poets composed splendid verses on the nightingale in the forest by the deep sea
for he liked reading the brilliant accounts of the town
fancy reading for the first time about it in a book
he was so proud that if anyone of lower rank than his own ventured to speak to him or ask him anything
here is a most remarkable bird which is called a nightingale
they say it is the most glorious thing in my kingdom
why has no one ever said anything to me about it
through the halls and corridors but none of those he met had ever heard of the nightingale
told him that it must be an invention on the part of those who had written the books
your imperial majesty can not really believe all that is written
is sent me by his great majesty the emperor of japan so it can not be untrue
the whole court shall be trampled under foot after supper
said the first lord and he ran up and down stairs
for they did not want to be trampled under foot
everyone was asking after the wonderful nightingale which all the world knew of
at last they met a poor little girl in the kitchen
i have permission to carry the scraps over from the court meals to my poor sick mother
you shall have leave to see the emperor at dinner
for she is invited to come to court this evening
so they all went into the wood where the nightingale was wont to sing
when they were on the way there they heard a cow mooing
what a wonderful power for such a small beast to have
now we hear her it sounds like a little churchbell
she pointed to a little darkgrey bird up in the branches
she must surely have lost her feathers because she sees so many distinguished men round her
said the nightingale and she sang so gloriously that it was a pleasure to listen
it is wonderful that we have never heard her before
i have the great pleasure to invite you to court this evening
where his gracious imperial highness will be enchanted with your charming song
she came gladly when she heard that the emperor wished it
the porcelain walls and floors glittered in the light of many thousand gold lamps the most gorgeous flowers which tinkled out well were placed in the corridors
there was such a hurrying and draught that all the bells jingled so much that one could not hear oneself speak
in the centre of the great hall where the emperor sat was a golden perch
the little kitchenmaid was allowed to stand behind the door
everyone was looking towards the little grey bird to whom the emperor nodded
the nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into the emperor's eyes and ran down his cheeks
then the nightingale sang even more beautifully it went straight to all hearts
the emperor was so delighted that he said she should wear his gold slipper round her neck
i have seen tears in the emperor's eyes that is a great reward
that is the most charming coquetry i have ever seen
they all took to holding water in their mouths that they might gurgle whenever anyone spoke to them
the lackeys and chambermaids announced that they were pleased which means a great deal
for they are the most difficult people of all to satisfy
she had to stay at court now she had her own cage
permission to walk out twice in the day and once at night
who each held a silken string which was fastened round her leg
when two people met each other one would say nightin
one day the emperor received a large parcel on which was written the nightingale
which lay in a box an artificial nightingale which was like the real one
round its neck was a little collar on which was written
the nightingale of the emperor of japan is nothing compared to that of the emperor of china
the man who had brought the clockwork bird received on the spot the title of bringer of the imperial first nightingale
now they must sing together what a duet we shall have
for the real nightingale sang in her way and the clockwork bird sang waltzes
said the bandmaster it keeps very good time and is quite after my style
it gave just as much pleasure as the real one
then it was so much prettier to look at it sparkled like bracelets and necklaces
threeandthirty times it sang the same piece without being tired
but the emperor thought that the living nightingale should sing now but where was she
no one had noticed that she had flown out of the open window away to her green woods
they said and the artificial bird had to sing again
that was the thirtyfourth time they had heard the same piece
but they did not yet know it by heart it was much too difficult
he assured them it was better than a real nightingale
with the real nightingale one can never tell what will come out
you can open it and show people where the waltzes lie
said everyone and the bandmaster received permission to show the bird to the people the next sunday
they were as pleased as if they had been intoxicated with tea
but the poor fishermen who had heard the real nightingale said this one sings well enough
the tunes glide out but there is something wanting i don't know what
the artificial bird was put on silken cushions by the emperor's bed
for the emperor counted that side as the more distinguished
being the side on which the heart is the emperor's heart is also on the left
the bandmaster wrote a work of twentyfive volumes about the artificial bird
so full of the hardest chinese words that everyone said they had read it and understood it for once they had been very stupid about a book
all the chinese knew every note of the artificial bird's song by heart
but they liked it all the better for this they could even sing with it
all the wheels ran down and then the music ceased
but he said that it must be very seldom used as the works were nearly worn out
only once a year was the artificial bird allowed to sing
but then the bandmaster made a little speech full of hard words
the people stood outside in the street and asked the first lord how the old emperor was
cold and pale lay the emperor in his splendid great bed the whole court believed him dead
one after the other left him to pay their respects to the new emperor
everywhere in the halls and corridors cloth was laid down so that no footstep could be heard
the emperor longed for something to come and relieve the monotony of this deathlike stillness
the moon was streaming in at the open window but that
i gave you gold and jewels i have hung my gold slipper round your neck with my own hand sing
all at once there came in at the window the most glorious burst of song
had heard the need of her emperor and had come to sing to him of comfort and hope
as she sang the blood flowed quicker and quicker in the emperor's weak limbs
i brought tears to your eyes the first time i sang
but now sleep and get strong again i will sing you a lullaby
the sun was shining through the window when he awoke
i will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces
i can not build my nest in the palace and live here but let me come whenever i like
i will sit in the evening on the bough outside the window
i will sing you something that will make you feel happy and grateful
of sorrow i will sing of the evil and the good which lies hidden from you
to all those who are far away from you and your court
though that has about it a brightness as of something holy
now i will sing to you again but you must promise me one thing anything
don't tell anyone that you have a little bird who tells you everything
the servants came in to look at their dead emperor
once upon a time there were a king and a queen who had an only daughter
hermod and hadvor often played together while they were children
liked each other so much that while they were still young they secretly plighted their troth to each other
when he came she told him that she had no long time to live
that if he married another wife he should promise to take no other one than the queen of hetland the good
as he sailed there came upon him so thick a mist that he altogether lost his bearings
after walking for some time he came to a forest
went in the direction of the sound until he came to a clearing
was beautifully and grandly dressed she held a harp in her hands
but it was not so grand as the first one's
was very pretty to look at she had a green cloak over her other clothes
it was easy to see that she was maid to the other two
after the king had looked at them for a little he went forward and saluted them
the one that sat on the golden chair asked him who he was and where he was going and he told her all the story how he was a king
the king immediately asked her hand she gladly received his proposal and accepted him at once
made their way to the ship and after that nothing is told of their voyage until the king reached his own country
celebrated his marriage with this woman and after that things are quiet for a time
hermod and hadvor took but little notice of the queen and her daughter
no sooner was he away than the queen came to talk with hermod
hermod told her straight and plain that he would not do so
said that in that case neither should he have hadvor
that he should go to a desert island and there be a lion by day and a man by night
from this spell he should never be freed until hadvor burned the lion's skin
as soon as the queen had finished her speech hermod replied that he also laid a spell on her
that as soon as he was freed from her enchantments she should become a rat and her daughter a mouse
fight with each other in the hall until he killed them with his sword
no one knew what had become of him the queen caused search to be made for him
she asked the princess if she knew where hermod had gone to
hermod has disappeared through the wicked devices of the queen
because hermod would not fall in with the queen's plans
to go on an island and be a lion by day and a man by night
never be freed from this until you burn the lion's skin
she has looked out a match for you she has a brother in the underworld
whom she means to turn into a beautiful prince and get him married to you
this is no new thing for the queen she took me away from my parents house and compelled me to serve her but she has never done me any harm
for the green cloak i wear protects me against all mischief
hadvor now became still sadder than before at the thought of the marriage destined for her
entreated olof to think of some plan to save her
that your wooer will come up through the floor of the castle to you
so you must be prepared when you hear the noise of his coming and the floor begins to open
about this time the king came home from his expedition
thought it a great blow that no one knew what had become of hermod but the queen consoled him as best she could
after a time the king thought less about his disappearance
had made preparations to receive her wooer when he came
a loud noise and rumbling was heard under the castle
whereupon hadvor made them take the caldron of pitch and pour plenty of it into the opening
that hadvor shall be unable to say anything against the charges that i shall bring against her
the body of the dead giant now became that of a beautiful prince
that your daughter is as good as she is said to be
i have just found his dead body lying at the palace gate
the king went along with the queen to see the body
the queen asked leave to decide what hadvor's punishment should be
the queen's decision was that the king should make a big gravemound for her brother
whereupon hadvor earnestly entreated her to tell her what to do
you must get a wide cloak to wear over your other clothes
the giant's ghost will walk after you are both left together in there
he will ask you to cut pieces out of his legs to give to the dogs
but that you must not promise to do unless he tells you where hermod has gone to
so as to get out of the mound but he means to cheat you all the same
will catch you by the cloak to pull you back again but you must take care to have the cloak loose on your shoulders
into it hadvor also had to go without being allowed to make any defence
after they were both left there everything happened just as olof had said
asked hadvor to cut the pieces out of his legs for the dogs but she refused until he told her that hermod was in a desert island
the giant then let her get up on his shoulders to get out of the mound
as she sprang out he caught hold of her cloak but she had taken care to let it lie loose on her shoulders
to where she knew there was the shortest distance over to the island in which hermod was
on reaching the island she found a sandy beach all along by the sea
nor could she see any way to get up these
being both sad at heart and tired with the long journey
as she slept she dreamed that a tall woman came to her and said
he is on this island but it will be hard for you to get to him if you have no one to help you
for you can not climb the cliffs by your own strength
by which you will be able to climb up and as the island is so large that you might not find hermod's dwellingplace so easily
the clew will run on before and show you the way
to put on when you awaken it will keep you from growing faint with hunger
the clew led her on till she came to the mouth of a cave
when evening came she heard the noise of footsteps outside
became aware that the lion had come to the mouth of the cave
after which she heard a man coming towards the couch
because she heard him speaking to himself about his own condition
calling to mind hadvor and other things in the old days
then she went back into the cave and wakened hermod
were most at a loss to know how to get out of the island
said she suspected there was some one in the island who would be able to help them
asked her to help them to get to the mainland
for the giant that was buried will be waiting for you
if you meet the whale and think your lives are in danger
but on the way they saw a huge fish coming towards them
thought they had as good reason as ever they would have to call on the witch
the next minute they saw coming after them another huge whale
all of these swam past the boat and went on to meet the whale
the sea became so stormy that it was not very easy to keep the boat from being filled by the waves
they saw that the sea was dyed with blood the big whale and the fifteen smaller ones disappeared
but a rat and a mouse were always fighting with each other there
ever so many people had tried to drive them away
while the king was almost beside himself with sorrow and care for the loss of his queen
he went to where the rat and the mouse were fighting
all were astonished then by seeing two witches lying dead on the floor of the hall
who was very glad to be rid of such vile creatures
gave the kingdom to him as well and so hermod became king
the steadfast tinsoldier there were once upon a time fiveand twenty tinsoldiers all brothers
as they were made out of the same old tin spoon
they shouldered their guns and looked straight in front of them
when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off
clapping his hands they had been given to him because it was his birthday
who had been made last when the tin had run short but there he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others did on two
there were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out
but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard
with windows through which you could see into the rooms
in front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake
wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it
that was all very pretty but the most beautiful thing was a little lady
but she had on a dress of the finest muslin
with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders
fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper
was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the tinsoldier couldn't find it anywhere
then he stretched himself out behind a snuffbox that lay on the table from thence he could watch the dainty little lady
who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance
when the night came all the other tinsoldiers went into their box
the slatepencil ran about the slate there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them
the only two who did not stir from their places were the tinsoldier and the little dancer
with both arms outstretched he stood steadfastly on his one leg
off flew the lid of the snuffbox but there was no snuff inside
only a little black imp that was the beauty of it
don't look at things that aren't intended for the likes of you
the tinsoldier was put in the window and whether it was the wind or the little black imp
but all at once the window flew open and out fell the little tinsoldier
he landed on his head with his leg in the air
the nurserymaid and the little boy came down at once to look for him
though they were so near him that they almost trod on him
if the tinsoldier had only called out here i am
they must have found him but he did not think it fitting for him to cry out
soon it began to drizzle then the drops came faster
made him sail up and down the gutter both the boys ran along beside him
in the middle of the stream it went so quick that the tinsoldier trembled but he remained steadfast
all at once the boat passed under a long tunnel that was as dark as his box had been
if only the little lady were sitting beside me in the boat
it might be twice as dark for all i should care
suddenly there came along a great waterrat that lived in the tunnel
as he cried to the chips of wood and straw hold him
the tinsoldier could already see daylight where the tunnel ended but in his ears there sounded a roaring enough to frighten any brave man
now he was so near to it that he could not hold on any longer
the poor tinsoldier keeping himself as stiff as he could no one should say of him afterwards that he had flinched
became filled to the brim with water it began to sink
the tinsoldier was standing up to his neck in water
softer and softer grew the paper now the water was over his head
the soldier fell but at that moment he was swallowed by a great fish
then it was as if a flash of lightning had passed through him the daylight streamed in
where the cook had cut it open with a great knife
she took up the soldier between her finger and thumb
where everyone wanted to see the hero who had been found inside a fish but the tinsoldier was not at all proud
the tinsoldier was in the same room in which he had been before
the same toys on the table and there was the same grand castle with the pretty little dancer
she was still standing on one leg with the other high in the air she too was steadfast
he was nearly going to shed tintears but that would not have been fitting for a soldier
all at once one of the little boys took up the tinsoldier
giving no reasons but doubtless the little black imp in the snuffbox was at the bottom of this too
felt a heat that was truly terrible but whether he was suffering from actual fire
all his colour had disappeared whether this had happened on his travels or whether it was the result of trouble
he felt that he was melting but he remained steadfast
off she flew like a sylph to the tinsoldier in the stove
burst into flames and that was the end of her
when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes
there was nothing left of the little dancer but her gilt rose
blockheadhans far away in the country lay an old manorhouse where lived an old squire who had two sons
that if they had known only half of what they did know
for she had proclaimed that she would have for her husband the man who knew best how to choose his words
one knew the whole latin dictionary and also three years issue of the daily paper of the town off by heart
so that he could repeat it all backwards or forwards as you pleased
knew by heart what every member of the corporation ought to know
so that he thought he could quite well speak on state matters and give his opinion
their old father gave each of them a fine horse the one who knew the dictionary and the daily paper by heart had a black horse
while the other who was so clever at corporation law had a milkwhite one
then they oiled the corners of their mouths so that they might be able to speak more fluently
all the servants stood in the courtyard and saw them mount their steeds
here by chance came the third brother for the squire had three sons
don't you know what is known throughout all the country side
cried blockheadhans and the brothers laughed at him and rode off
you can't speak you don't know how to choose your words
i will take the goat which is mine he can carry me
singing so that the echoes were roused far and near
but they were thinking over all the good things they were going to say
he showed them a dead crow which he had picked up
you don't find such things every day on the road
the brothers turned round to see what in the world he could have found
returned blockheadhans and the brothers laughed and rode on a good way
but the brothers rode on so fast that dust and sparks flew all around
they reached the gate of the town a good hour before blockheadhans
they were so tightly packed that they could not move their arms
for otherwise they would have torn each other in pieces
merely because the one was in front of the other
all the country people were standing round the king's throne
at last she came to the row in which the brother who knew the dictionary by heart was
but he did not know it any longer he had quite forgotten it in the rank and file
by each window were standing three reporters and an editor and each of them was writing down what was said
to publish it in the paper that came out and was sold at the street corners for a penny
they had made up the fire so hot that it was grilling
he was not prepared for such a speech he did not know what to say
now blockheadhans came in he rode his goat right into the hall
replied blockheadhans then can i roast a crow with them
said the princess but have you anything you can roast them in
said the princess but where shall we get the soup from
i have so much that i can quite well throw some away
i will marry you but do you know that every word which we are saying and have said has been taken down and will be in the paper tomorrow
by each window do you see there are standing three reporters and an old editor
i couldn't have done it but i will soon learn how to
sat on the throne and this we have still damp from the newspaper of the editor and the reporters and they are not to be believed for a moment
a story about a darningneedle there was once a darningneedle who thought herself so fine that she believed she was an embroideryneedle
said the darningneedle to the fingers who were holding her
if i once fall on the ground i shall never be found again
said the darningneedle as she drew a long thread after her but there was no knot at the end of the thread
the fingers were using the needle on the cook's shoe
the upper leather was unstitched and had to be sewn together
said the fingers but they had to hold her tight while the cook dropped some sealingwax on the needle and stuck it in the front of her dress
she laughed to herself you can never see when a darningneedle is laughing
then she sat up as proudly as if she were in a state coach
may i be allowed to ask if you are gold
for it is not everyone who has a head of sealingwax
so saying the darningneedle raised herself up so proudly that she fell out of the dress
right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out
said she as she lay in the gutter but i know who i am
the darningneedle kept her proud bearing and did not lose her goodtemper
there goes a shaving thinking of nothing in the world but of itself
one day something thick lay near her which glittered so brightly that the darningneedle thought it must be a diamond
each believed that the other was something very costly and they both said how very proud the world must be of them
this lady was a cook she had five fingers on each hand anything so proud as these fingers i have never seen
yet they were only there to take me out of the workbox and to put me back again
could only make one bow but he said that if he were cut off from a man that he was no longer any use as a soldier
had a gold sash round his waist and little playman did nothing at all
at that moment more water came into the gutter it streamed over the edges and washed the bit of bottleglass away
i really believe i must have been born a sunbeam
it seems to me as if the sunbeams were always looking under the water for me
i am so fine that my own mother can not find me
i believe i could weep but i can't it is not fine to weep
one day two streeturchins were playing and wading in the gutter
as he pricked himself with the darningneedle he is a fine fellow though
i am not a fellow i am a young lady
she had become quite black but black makes one look very slim
the walls white and i black what a pretty contrast it makes
it is a good thing to be steeled against seasickness here one has indeed an advantage over man
alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank
of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading
whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies
when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this
but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket
fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge
never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next
she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to
but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade
but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it
even if i fell off the top of the house
i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time
i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
let me see that would be four thousand miles down
that's about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to
i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth
how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward
i think she was rather glad there was no one listening
but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is
she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air
what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking
itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime
had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah
tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves
she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up
but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage
there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind
she was close behind it when she turned the corner
but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long
which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other
all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key
alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but
but at any rate it would not open any of them
she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage
not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
how she longed to get out of that dark hall
wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains
but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through
it would be of very little use without my shoulders
how i wish i could shut up like a telescope
that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door
or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it
round the neck of the bottle was a paper label
with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters
but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry
see whether it's marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt
all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as
that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife
said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope
so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden
she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end
she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out
for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
she decided on going into the garden at once but
she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass
she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table
but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying
rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it
on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants
i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller
i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden
holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing
she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure
but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
cried alice now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was
i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now
i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them
or perhaps they won't walk the way i want to go
let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas
she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high
she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry
alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so
skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go
she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear
let me think was i the same when i got up this morning
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself
to see if she could have been changed for any of them
mine doesn't go in ringlets at all and im sure i can't be mabel
ill try if i know all the things i used to know
ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail
pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on
i shall have to go and live in that poky little house
ive made up my mind about it if im mabel
itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again
i shall only look up and say who am i then
i am so very tired of being all alone here
as she said this she looked down at her hands
was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking
she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it
was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding
but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden
she ran with all speed back to the little door but
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before
her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea
alice had been to the seaside once in her life
that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea
she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off
she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus
she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate
alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before
but she remembered having seen in her brother's latin grammar
a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse
seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes
alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened
the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water
said alice in a soothing tone don't be angry about it
yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she's such a capital one for catching mice oh
we won't talk about her any more if youd rather not
who was trembling down to the end of his tail
in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation
so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you
all sorts of things i can't remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer
he says it kills all the rats and oh dear
for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale
youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs
for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo
they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers
how to get dry again they had a consultation about this
after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them
must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was
who seemed to be a person of authority among them
for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon
had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means
said the duck it's generally a frog or a worm
found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown
but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now
said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn't seem to dry me at all
for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english
i don't know the meaning of half those long words
the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly
that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace
but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak
the best way to explain it is to do it
so that it was not easy to know when the race was over
when they had been running half an hour or so
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought
it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and
but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and
the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion
as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs
the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
looking down with wonder at the mouse's tail but why do you call it sad
she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking
so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse
let us both go to law i will prosecute you
ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do
said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend
alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus
as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah
let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper
for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinah's our cat
she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it
some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully
i really must be getting home the nightair doesn't suit my throat
a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children
i wonder if i shall ever see you any more
she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance
as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess
alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves
but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool
alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to
how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am
but id better take him his fan and gloves that is
on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w
in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann
be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves
she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice
but ive got to see that the mouse doesn't get out
that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window
on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves
when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass
there was no label this time with the words drink me
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips
whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does
for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle
had to stoop to save her neck from being broken
saying to herself that's quite enough i hope i shan't grow any more as it is
i can't get out at the door i do wish i hadn't drunk quite so much
very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this
she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door
the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again
i almost wish i hadn't gone down that rabbithole and yet and yet it's rather curious
she added in a sorrowful tone at least there's no room to grow up any more here
shall i never get any older than i am now
one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn
making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs
alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her
quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit
alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window
after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe
alice could only hear whispers now and then such as
im sure i don't want to stay in here any longer
she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels
the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words where's the other ladder
i hadn't to bring but one bill's got the other bill
tieem together first they don't reach half high enough yet oh
i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow
to be sure but i think i can kick a little
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could
waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill
then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now don't choke him how was it
thank ye im better now but im a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is
said the rabbit's voice and alice called out as loud as she could
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor
it's sure to make some change in my size and as it can't possibly make me larger
as soon as she was small enough to get through the door
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could
is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees
a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle
to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side
tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice
thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse
ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
till at last it sat down a good way off
this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once
ran till she was quite tired and out of breath
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance
fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much
if if id only been the right size to do it
id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again
i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is
alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass
but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it
it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else
the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning
but i think i must have been changed several times since then
for i can't understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar's making such very short remarks
here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason
as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing
said alice i can't remember things as i used and i don't keep the same size for ten minutes together
ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee
your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think
have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray
i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple
your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose
with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it
argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength
one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
alice hastily replied only one doesn't like changing so often
alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before
said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be
said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice
just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round
at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
but she felt that there was no time to be lost
as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last
when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see
which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head
was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag
which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering
when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face
but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day
i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
just as id taken the highest tree in the wood
just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last
as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
ive seen a good many little girls in my time
i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg
who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do
that she was quite silent for a minute or two
i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent
alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands
until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes
ive got back to my right size the next thing is
to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done
with a little house in it about four feet high
itll never do to come upon them this size why
did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house
when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles
she felt very curious to know what it was all about
crept a little way out of the wood to listen
the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter
that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone
the other was sitting on the ground near the door
because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly
certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing
as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces
he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking
she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head
till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened
straight at the footman's head it just grazed his nose
broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him
no doubt only alice did not like to be told so
the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark
which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle
nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup
there was certainly too much of it in the air
even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby
it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause
the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze
a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear
for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first
she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby
went on again i didn't know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact
alice did not at all like the tone of this remark
thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation
the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
the world would go round a deal faster than it does
who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
just think of what work it would make with the day and night
you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes
to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
giving it a violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy
beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song
that alice could hardly hear the words i speak severely to my boy
i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases
i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen
the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
it was as much as she could do to hold it
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot
then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot
theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind
said alice that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself
alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it
there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose
what am i to do with this creature when i get it home
that she looked down into its face in some alarm
this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig
she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood
it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig
she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth
so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however
that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
she went on and how do you know that youre mad
while she was looking at the place where it had been
just as if it had come back in a natural way
after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live
she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting
perhaps as this is may it won't be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march
replied alice and i wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy
said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly
which remained some time after the rest of it had gone
it's the most curious thing i ever saw in my life
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur
that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom
raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly
saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all
i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them
but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room
she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table
then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it
it wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited
said alice it's laid for a great many more than three
he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity
the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was
do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it
alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that's the same thing
you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see
that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like
that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe
while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks
turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket
the hatter grumbled you shouldn't have put it in with the breadknife
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea
looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
alice replied very readily but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together
the hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it
of course just what i was going to remark myself
i think you might do something better with the time
than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers
alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music
just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time
said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldn't be hungry for it
said the hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked
you know it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts
twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop
is that the reason so many teathings are put out here
but what happens when you come to the beginning again
feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying
the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie
tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on
who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking
alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like
so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well
said the hatter it's very easy to take more than nothing
alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter
why did they live at the bottom of a well
the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it
so these three little sisters they were learning to draw
the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse's place
alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare
the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before
as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate
said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewell eh
that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it
for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m why with an m
muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust
neither of the others took the least notice of her going
half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them
they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot
said alice as she picked her way through the wood
it's the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my life
she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it
i think i may as well go in at once
a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white
just as she came up to them she heard one of them say
i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
ill tell him it was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions
of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice
we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out
the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners
with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds
after these came the royal children there were ten of them
the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand
among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner
carrying the king's crown on a crimson velvet cushion and
alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners
but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides
if people had all to lie down upon their faces
pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for
the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners
she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near
the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two
said alice i don't think it's at all a pity
alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs
the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away
just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out
was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head
it would twist itself round and look up in her face
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself
was in the act of crawling away besides all this
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to
as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground
alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed
the players all played at once without waiting for turns
fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion
she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen
theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is
when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first
she said to herself it's the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to
as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with
feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight
they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak and they don't seem to have any rules in particular at least
nobody attends to them and youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance
there's the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queen's hedgehog just now
said alice she's so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her
the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties
she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns
she did not like the look of things at all
as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was
that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden
where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree
by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn't matter much
as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
went back for a little more conversation with her friend
she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner
she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before
he wasn't going to begin at his time of life
that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed
it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious
alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it
the cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone
by the time he had come back with the duchess
it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it
while the rest of the party went back to the game
you can't think how glad i am to see you again
alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen
i won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all
soup does very well without maybe it's always pepper that makes people hottempered
very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule
vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered
i only wish people knew that then they wouldn't be so stingy about it
you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time
was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
i can't tell you just now what the moral of that is
she squeezed herself up closer to alice's side as she spoke
alice did not much like keeping so close to her first
because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice's shoulder
said the duchess and the moral of that is oh
digging her sharp little chin into alice's shoulder as she added
the moral of that is take care of the sense
i dare say youre wondering why i don't put my arm round your waist
not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried
the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together
said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things
who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there's a large mustardmine near here
the moral of that is the more there is of mine
if i had it written down but i can't quite follow it as you say it
that's nothing to what i could say if i chose
pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
i make you a present of everything ive said as yet
but she did not venture to say it out loud
as pigs have to fly and the m but here
the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off
the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word
the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence
the queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives
all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players
those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this
so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left
for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered
i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off
alice did not quite like the look of the creature
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled
as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock
alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break
who looked at them with large eyes full of tears
but she could not help thinking there must be more to come
the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise
said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice
though you mayn't believe it i never said i didn't
we went to school every day ive been to a dayschool
said alice you needn't be so proud as all that
said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief
now at ours they had at the end of the bill
the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition
alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it
with seaography then drawling the drawlingmaster was an old congereel
that used to come once a week he taught us drawling
the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief
sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws
the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day
she thought it over a little before she made her next remark
the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now
but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
same as if he had a bone in his throat
said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back
he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea
' so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is
you first form into a line along the seashore two lines
when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way that generally takes some time
you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner
as far out to sea as you can swim after them
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time
every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close
very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance
you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us
gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly
the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale
feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting
ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily
they have their tails in their mouths and theyre all over crumbs
said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea
but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes
that they would go with the lobsters to the dance
the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that
the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
said alice a little timidly but it's no use going back to yesterday
said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time
so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit
she was a little nervous about it just at first
her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old
i should like to hear her try and repeat something now
he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice
stand up and repeatt is the voice of the sluggard
thought alice i might as well be at school at once
but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille
the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare
so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons
lsb later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry
that's different from what i used to say when i was a child
alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing
the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden
she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden
how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie lsb later editions continued as follows the panther took piecrust
while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl
concluded the banquet rsb what is the use of repeating all that stuff
it's by far the most confusing thing i ever heard
said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so
or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song
who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup
alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on
the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived
with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts
as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them
with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit
in the very middle of the court was a table
with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good
that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish theyd get the trial done
alice had never been in a court of justice before
she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there
was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig
look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it
she said this last word two or three times over to herself
that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round
as well as if she were looking over their shoulders
she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell stupid
that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trial's over
she did it so quickly that the poor little juror could not make out at all what had become of it so
he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet
said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet
he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other
for bringing these in but i hadn't quite finished my tea when i was sent for
the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates
the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other
in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation
which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again
he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter
she said to one of the officers of the court
bring me the list of the singers in the last concert
most things twinkled after that only the march hare said i didn't
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing
i cut some more breadandbutter but what did the dormouse say
i will just explain to you how it was done
which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig
which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door
by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight
alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like
quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes
she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below
reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox
until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all
the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way
she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset
their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them
they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident
who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates
but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best
as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn't matter a bit
who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook
all persons more than a mile high to leave the court
that's not a regular rule you invented it just now
jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up
they can't prove i did there's no name signed at the end
or else youd have signed your name like an honest man
there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
go on till you come to the end then stop
these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her
mentioned me to him she gave me a good character
he sent them word i had not gone if she should push the matter on
you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair
my notion was that you had been an obstacle that came between him
that's the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it
she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him
i don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it
she doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it
looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them
he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that's the jury
it goes on they all returned from him to you
then again before she had this fit you never had fits
the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger
as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again
at this the whole pack rose up into the air
came flying down upon her she gave a little scream
who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished
certainly but now run in to your tea it's getting late
but her sister sat still just as she left her
once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee
the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened
the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream
the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchess's knee
while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon
mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
though she knew she had but to open them again
all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind
the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells
the queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby
would change to the confused clamour of the busy farmyard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle's heavy sobs
she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would
be herself a grown woman and how she would keep
the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children
make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale
perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows
a patent medicine testimonial you might as well try to move the rock of gibraltar as attempt to change uncle abimelech's mind when it is once made up
murray is like dear old dad he gets discouraged rather easily
as uncle abimelech has never failed to tell me when i have annoyed him
if i had folded my hands and sat down meekly when uncle abimelech made known his good will and pleasure regarding murray and me after father's death
murray would never have got to college nor i either
i just wanted to go to college because murray did
i knew that he never had been known to change it
i had determined that this was to be the first time for him
i hadn't any idea how i was going to bring it about but it just had to be done
i knew i would have to depend on my own thinkers
even if he hadn't settled beforehand that there was no use in opposing uncle abimelech
im going up to the garret to think this out
if uncle abimelech comes over don't tell him where i am
if i don't come down in time to get tea
i shall not leave the garret until i have thought of some way to change uncle abimelech's mind
then youll be a prisoner there for the term of your natural life
prue and youve got enough decision for two but youll never get the better of uncle abimelech
i shut the door and bolted it good and fast to make sure
leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house
one rolypoly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and sat there for a minute
down below i could see murray in a corner of the yard
he had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health
from the garret windows i could see all over the farm
for the house is on the hill end of it
i could see all the dear old fields and the spring meadow and the beech woods in the southwest corner
it was a dear old place and both murray and i loved every stick and stone on it
but there was no reason why we should go on living there when murray didn't like farming
father and murray and i had always lived here together
that was one reason why uncle abimelech was set against murray going to college
although murray is as chubby and sturdy a fellow as you could wish to see
the doctors told him that his only chance of recovering his strength was an openair life
so father rented one of uncle abimelech's farms and there he lived for the rest of his days
he did not get strong again until it was too late for college
he was a square peg in a round hole all his life
so murray and dad and i were everything to each other
although we were bossed by uncle abimelech more or less
of course when murray and i came to look our position squarely in the face we found that we were dependent on uncle abimelech for everything
we were literally as poor as church mice and even poorer
murray's heart was set on going to college and studying medicine
you know that when i put my foot down something squashes
it was not that uncle abimelech was miserly or that he grudged us assistance
when murray was twentyone uncle abimelech said he would deed the farm to him make him a present of it out and out
your father never made more than a bare living out of it because he wasn't strong enough to work it properly that's what he got out of a college course
but you are strong enough and ambitious enough to do well
he sat and listened to me with a quizzical smile on that handsome
you ought to be the one to go to college if either of you did
murray can take or leave the farm as he chooses
it makes me angry to be called a little girl when i put up my hair a year ago
but no way out of the dilemma could i see
i had eaten up all the apples i had brought with me and i felt flabby and disconsolate
i picked up the paper my apples had been wrapped in and looked it over gloomily
looking out of the garret window right down on the little bald spot on the top of uncle abimelech's head
as he stood laying down the law to murray about something
when uncle abimelech had gone i went down to murray
you must back me up no matter what i do and let me have my own way in it all
remember that your role is to lie low and say nothing
it cured your sprain after you had tried everything else
what with your sprain and my rheumatics i think i can manage it
are you sure that long brooding over our troubles up in the garret hasn't turned your brain
there is just one trait of uncle abimelech's disposition more marked than his fondness for having his own way and that one thing is family pride
the name dates back to the norman conquest when a certain roger de melville
i don't think the melvilles ever did anything worth recording in history since
respectable folks and i think that is something worth being proud of
but uncle abimelech pinned his family pride to roger de melville
he had the melville coat of arms and our family tree
he would not have done anything that would not have chimed in with that coat of arms and a conquering ancestor for the world
at the end of a week i got an answer to my letter
one day i saw uncle abimelech striding up the lane
who was poring over a book of anatomy in the corner
there is going to be a battle royal between us
old roger de melville himself never could have looked fiercer
no use in having your name on the roll of battle abbey if you can't stand your ground
he started to say something but remembered just in time and stopped
although he won't own up to it and laughs at uncle abimelech
below was the letter i had written to the alloway anodyne liniment folks
it was a florid testimonial to the virtues of their liniment
i said that it had cured murray's sprain after all other remedies had failed and that
when i had been left a partial wreck from a very bad attack of rheumatic fever
the only thing that restored my joints and muscles to working order was alloway's anodyne liniment
although i dare say old aunt sarahfromthehollow's rubbing had as much to do with the cures as the liniment
it just means one of my ways of making money
they gave me fifty dollars for the privilege of publishing them
fifty dollars will pay for books and tuition for murray and me at kentville academy next winter
andmistress tredgold is kind enough to say she will board me for what help i can give her around the house
wait for murray's until he can earn it by teaching
i rattled all this off glibly before uncle abimelech could get in a word
think of sir roger de melville and a patent medicine advertisement
to let your sister disgrace herself and her family name by such an outrageous transaction
it's an honest business transaction enough and the family name alone won't send us to college
but ive signed a contract that it is to run for six months
you remember the herb cure you recommended one spring and that it did me so much good
im negotiating with the makers of that and the girl's mad
but i reminded him of his promise and he had to succumb
next day uncle abimelech returned a subdued and chastened uncle abimelech
i am not going to have the name of melville dragged all over the country in a patent medicine advertisement
if you will add thereto your promise that you will forget and forgive
youve worked your little scheme through trust a foster for that
but in future youve got to remember that in law youre a melville whatever you are in fact
after everything had been arranged and uncle abimelech had gone i looked at murray
all day aunt martha has kept her room to rest
my name is marguerite forrester an absurdly long name for so small a girl
i have always lived with aunt martha my parents died when i was a baby
aunt martha says i am to be her heiress if i please her which means but
she is not quite so far gone in petrifaction as aunt
my flesh and blood are still unreasonably warm and pulsing and rebellious
aunt martha would be in danger of taking a fit if she ever saw me talking to a man
firmly determined to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenthcentury masculine attire
so i have to walk demurely and assume a virtue
while i pine after the untested fleshpots of egypt in secret
we have come down to spend a few weeks at fir cottage
for there are times when i absolutely must talk to someone or go mad
i go to the sandshore with aunt martha andmistress saxby in the morning
she says her man brought it home from furrin parts before he died
while aunt andmistress saxby meander up and down the shore
i amuse myself by examining distant seas and coasts through it
although there is a large summer hotel about a mile up the beach
our shore haunts do not seem to be popular with its guests
i may also add that it doesn't suit her niece but that is a matter of small importance
the first morning i noticed a white object on the rocks
there apparently within a stone's throw of me was a young man
there was something about his face that reminded me of someone i know
i wonder what aunt would say if she knew what i am so earnestly watching through my glass at times
for he was also looking through a spyglass straight at me
yet my curiosity was so strong that a few minutes afterward i peeped back again
i dropped my glass and smiled in a mixture of dismay and amusement
then i remembered that he was probably watching me again
shut my glass up and did not touch it again
fully resolved not even to glance in the forbidden direction
but in the end i had to take a peep
saw him on the rocks with his glass levelled at me
when he saw that i was looking he laid down the glass
i gave one frantic glance at aunt martha's rigid back
then watched him while he deftly spelled i am francis shelmardine
have i not heard endless dissertations from connie on this wonderful brother of hers
until he has become the only hero of dreams i have ever had
he looked quite crestfallen and disappointed as he spelled out why not
under the circumstances there could be no useless circumlocution in our exchange of ideas
ran something like this you are not displeased with me
shall i bring her over to vouch for my character
would you object to knowing me on your own account
you will not refuse to chat with me thus now and then
as we wentmistress saxby complimented me on my good colour
if i were really ill aunt would spend her last cent in my behalf
but she would be just as well pleased to see me properly pale and subdued at all times
not looking as if i were too well contented in this vale of tears
i have talked a good deal with mister shelmardine these past four days
he is to be at the beach for some weeks longer
this morning he signalled across from the rocks i mean to see you at last
i can not prevent him from promenading on our beach all day if he chooses
aunt would speedily leave him in sole possession of it
it is dreadful of me to be deceiving her and i do feel guilty
i sat down on the sand and pretended to read the memoirs of a missionary aunt likes cheerful books like that in an agony of anticipation
i felt my heart beating to my very finger tips
he halted by the fragment of an old stranded boat
he lifted his hat with a twinkle in his eye
but aunt martha andmistress saxby are both such rigid church people that they would not darken the doors of the methodist church at plover sands for any consideration
would she relent ifmistress allardyce were to call for you
but i feel almost sure that she will not consent
it is not very far and i will be very careful
aunt merely gave me a look that said about forty distinct and separate things
i was turning away in despair whenmistress saxby bless her heart said i really think it would be no harm to let the child go
i will think it over and let you know in the morning
everything depends on the sort of humour aunt is in in the morning
condescendingly i think you may attend church if you wish
remember that i expect you to conduct yourself with becoming prudence and modesty
i flew upstairs and pulled my prettiest dress out of my trunk
aunt martha and i have a battle royal over it
i verily believe that aunt would like me to dress in the fashions in vogue in her youth
there is always a certain flavour of oldfashionedness about my gowns and hats
connie used to say that it was delicious and gave me a piquant uniqueness a certain unlikeness to other people that possessed a positive charm
but i had had my own way about this dress and it is really very becoming
i pinned at my belt the sweetest cluster of oldfashioned blush rosebuds from the garden
then i borrowed a hymn book frommistress blake and ran down to undergo aunt martha's scrutiny
you don't know how much aunt can express in a sniff
he was sitting right across from me and a smile glimmered in his eyes
through the service i was subdued enough to have satisfied even aunt martha
he waited for me at the entrance to his pew
i pretended not to see him until he said good morning
which sounded as though it might become infinitely tender if its owner chose
when we went down the steps he took my hymnal
i had a hard time to get aunt martha's consent
i wouldn't have succeeded ifmistress saxby hadn't taken my part
but is there any known way of overcoming your aunt's scruples
but she will never stop trying to bring me up
the process will be going on when i am fifty
i don't know what she would do if she saw me now
mister shelmardine frowned and switched the unoffending daisies viciously with his cane
then there is no hope of my seeing you openly and aboveboard
after a brief silence we began to talk of other things
he told me how he happened to see me first
i was curious to know who the people were who were always in the same place at the same time
when i went back to the hotel i askedmistress allardyce if she knew who the boarders at fir cottage were and she told me
when we reached the lane i held out my hand for the hymnal
suppose i were to walk up to the cottage tomorrow and ask for you
he looked so capable of doing anything he took it into his head to do
of course i would not do anything that would cause you unpleasantness
but this must not shall not be our last meeting
i shall be at the old boat tomorrow afternoon at twothirty
i unpinned the whole cluster and handed it to him
i scuttled up the lane in the most undignified fashion
on monday afternoon i slipped away to the shore while aunt martha andmistress saxby were taking their regular nap and i was supposed to be reading sermons in my room
but he came swiftly across the sand to meet me
but it is so lonely there and one can't be interested in sermons and memoirs all the time
mister andmistress allardyce are on the other side of the boat
i never thought of the time until mister shelmardine said it was four o'clock
i wish you wouldn't put such ideas into my head
not if i read a whole volume of sermons right through
but aunt martha was not awake and i have been to the shore three afternoons since then
im going tomorrow for a boat sail with mister shelmardine and the allardyces
but i am afraid the former will do something rash soon
this afternoon he said i don't think i can stand this much longer
thereby causing that poor little conscience of yours such misery
but hadn't i better go frankly to your aunt and lay the whole case before her
you would never see me again if you did that
of course this means that aunt martha has discovered everything and the deserved punishment of my sins has overtaken me
i slipped away again this afternoon and went for that boat sail
we had a lovely time but were rather late getting in
the kinks and curls of my obstreperous hair were something awful
aunt gave me an unutterable look and then followed me up to my room in grim silence
aunt was too horrorstricken to think of asking how i first made mister shelmardine's acquaintance
but i suppose my crimes simply seemed to her too enormous for words
when i had sobbed out my last word she rose
your aunt says that we are to go home on the afternoon train tomorrow
i will have no chance to explain matters to mister shelmardine
for aunt is quite capable of whisking me off to africa
i did not sleep a wink last night and crawled miserably down to breakfast
but to my surprise she toldmistress saxby that she intended taking a farewell walk to the shore
perhaps i would have a chance to send word to francis
since aunt did not know of the part my spyglass had played in my bad behaviour
i meekly followed my grim guardians to the shore and sat dejectedly on my rug while they paced the sand
as soon as aunt martha andmistress saxby were at a safe distance
i saw a look of desperate determination cross his face
i could not have torn my eyes from that glass
no time or chance for any maidenly hesitation or softening aureole of words
aunt andmistress saxby had almost reached the point where they invariably turned
i dropped behind them just once before we left the shore
i knew he was watching me and i waved my hand
bare front room of the baxter station hotel so called because there was no other house in the place to dispute the title was filled with men
some of them were putting up at the hotel while they worked at the new branch line
some of them had dropped in to exchange news and banter while waiting for the mail train
was playing at checkers with one of the railroad men
but was not too deeply absorbed in the game to take in all that was said around him
scarlet geraniums whichmistress foley kept in the bay window looked oddly out of place
gabe knew all those present except one man a stranger who had landed at baxter station from the afternoon freight
the stranger did not volunteer any information regarding his name or business
he had put in the afternoon and early evening strolling about the village and talking to the men on the branch line
now he had come in and ensconced himself in the corner behind the stove
he had a rather rough face and was flashily dressed
put as long as a man paid his bill and did not stir up a row gabe foley did not interfere with him
three or four farmers from out greenvale way were drawn up by the stove
presently he brought his tilted chair down with a sharp thud
gabe foley had paused in his manipulation of a king to hurl a question at the greenvale men
is it true that old man strong is to be turned out next week
stephen strong has got three years behind with the interest and moore is out of patience
how did stephen strong come to get into such a tight place
when i was in these parts a good many years ago he was considered a welltodo man
but he began to get in debt when his wife took sick
he spent no end of money on doctors and medicines for her
then he seemed to have a streak of bad luck besides crops failed and cows died and all that sort of thing
it's my opinion poor old stephen won't live any time if he's turned out of his home
he just let himself be imposed upon all his life
there's dozens of people owes him and he's never asked for a cent from them
he's always had some shiftless critter or other hanging round and devouring his substance
d'ye mind that ben butler who used to be in greenvale twenty years ago
if ever there was an imp of satan't was him old ezra butler's son from the valley
old stephen kept him for three or four years and was as good to him as if hed been his own son
even if he ain't been heard tell of for twenty years
he wasn't the kind you could forget in a hurry
he was a reg lar young villain up to every kind of mischief
old stephen caught him stealing his oats one time and stead of giving him a taste of jail for it
he just took him right into his family and kept him there for three years
i used to tell him hed be sorry for it
but he always persisted that ben wasn't bad at heart and would come out all right some day
no matter what the young varmint did old stephen would make excuses for him his ma was dead
i was thankful when he did finally clear out without doing some penitentiary work
if poor old stephen hadn't been so openhanded to every unfortunate critter he came across
the whistle of the mail train cut short the discussion of stephen strong's case
when left to himself he also rose and walked out
about three miles from the station he halted before a house built close to the road
with big barns in the rear and an orchard on the left slope
the house itself was in the shadow of the firs
but the yard lay out in the moonlight and the strange visitor did not elect to cross it
he turned aside into the shadow of the trees around the garden and
the windowblind was not down and he had a fairly good view of the room
the only visible occupant was a greyhaired old man sitting by the table
he hasn't changed much except that he's got mighty grey
it's a shame to turn an old man like him out of house and home
he drew himself softly up and sat on the fence
the old man remained on his knees for some time and then
he was chuckling to himself as he recalled all the mischief he had done in the old days the doubtful jokes
he could not help remembering at the same time how patient old stephen strong had always been with him
he recalled the time he had been caught stealing the oats
how gently the old man had talked to him and pointed out the sin of which he had been guilty
but in other respects he had not mended his ways much
behind old stephen's back he laughed at him and his preaching
he had always asserted mildly that ben would come out all right by and by
he was sorry he had fallen on such evil times
preaching and praying don't seem to have brought him out clear after all
ben butler had never felt easy when he mocked old stephen
i could do it but i reckon id be a blamed fool
fifteen years previously he had gone to the kootenay district with visions of making a fortune that were quickly dispelled by reality
it was only of late years that he had pulled up a bit
having some vague notion of buying a farm and settling down to do the respectable
they would be glad of another partner with some cash
as long as i stay here old stephen will haunt me
the next afternoon ben butler went over to greenvale and called at stephen strong's
many's the time ive wondered where you was and how you was getting on
you have seen a good bit more of the world than i ever have
but it ain't myself i come here to talk about not much to say if i did
they were telling me over at baxter that you were kind of in trouble
the old man's face clouded over all the sparkle went out of his kind blue eyes
ben im sorry for that id have liked to have ended my days here
i haven't a doubt but that it all fits into his wise purposes not a doubt
although it may be kind of hard to see it
i dunno as the lord has had much to do with this
seems to me as ift was the other one as was running it
the future looked very dark to him in his old age
ben put his hand inside his coat and brought out a brandnew
i reckon thatll keep you out of joe moore's clutches
there's three thousand there if i ain't made a mistake
ben slipped the rubber band around his wallet and replaced it airily
just to let you know i ain't ungrateful for all you did for me
if it hadn't been for you i might have been in the penitentiary by now
but we don't think anything more of a thousand or so in the kootenay than you greenvale folks do of a fiver not a bit more
are you sure you can afford it that you won't miss it
the tears were running down old stephen's face as he gathered up the money with a shaking hand
i just can't realize this yet it seems too good to be true
ill pay you back some of it anyhow if im spared a while longer
he said he had to leave on the 430 train
he was relieved when he got away from the old man's thanks and questions
ben did not find it easy to answer some of the latter
when he was out of sight of the house he sat on a fence and counted up his remaining funds
just enough to take me back to the kootenay and then begin over again
butt was worth the money to see the old fellow's face
how jake and waded roar to hear them two names in partnership
but im going to pull up a bit after this
twould be too bad to disappoint him if he's believed for so long that i was going to turn out all right yet
when the 430 train went out ben butler stood on the rear platform
but he paid up square and it is none of my business
an unconventional confidence the girl in blackandyellow ran frantically down the grey road under the pines
but she would have run if all halifax had been looking on
for had she not on the loveliest new hat a creation in yellow chiffon with big black choux and a dress to match
was there not a shower coming straight from the hills across the harbour
down at the end of the long resinous avenue the girl saw the shore road
with the pavilion shutting out the view of the harbour's mouth
cleanshaven george's island guarded the town like a sturdy bulldog
but she held her hat steady with one hand and ran on
it was a neckandneck race between the rain and the girl
just now the rain was beating into it on two sides
the young man thought that in all his life he had never seen anyone so pretty
as she straightened it with a careful hand and wondered if she looked very blown and blowsy
i suppose a mere man couldn't be expected to understand exactly
the girl thought that she had never seen such lovely brown eyes before
she was sure she knew all the nice young men with brown eyes in halifax
the young man smiled again at the idea of his sitting down because the girl was tired
i think that they are responsible for all the evils that they predict
i was determined to put on this hat and come out to the park today
i wasn't even aware that there was a football game on hand
as if he knew he ought to be ashamed of his ignorance
where can you have been not to have heard of it
beatrix says that it is just because of my innate contrariness
it is a wonder you didn't go to see it yourself
if anybody had ever told me that there would be a football game in halifax
that i would elect to prowl about by myself in the park instead of going to it
i was too crumpled up in my mind to care about football today
i had to come here and have it out with myself
i might get through with my mental gymnastics in time to go to the game afterwards
i got this hat and dress on purpose to wear to it
but i couldn't go to the game and take any interest in it
that is why i want to tell you about it
it is dreadful to be talking to you like this
i have reached that point where i must have a confidant
i tell it out loud to myself in the glass
i want to tell it to somebody who can say things back
the young man assured her that he would when the proper time came
but please don't look at me while im telling you
when beatrix wants to be particularly aggravating she says i have lost the art of blushing
the young man dragged his eyes from the face under the blackandyellow hat
fastened them on a crooked pine tree that hung out over the bank
he is the son of a man who was father's especial crony in boyhood
he comes of a family which has contracted a vile habit of marrying into our family
it has come down through the ages so long that it has become chronic
he and this friend agreed that the latter's son should marry one of father's daughters
it ought to have been beatrix she is the oldest
from my earliest recollection i have been given to understand that just as soon as i grew up there would be a readymade husband imported from england for me
the shadow of it has been over my whole life
when i was a very little girl i didn't mind it so much
it was such a long way off and lots of things might happen
the creature might run away with some other girl or i might have the smallpox or beatrix's nose might be straight when she grew up
if beatrix's nose were straight shed be a great deal prettier than i am
but nothing did happen and her nose is puggier than ever
i never could have a single little bit of fun
she had scores of lovers in spite of her nose
she wasn't told that there was a man in england whom she must marry by and by
when he got sufficiently reconciled to the idea to come and ask her
i couldn't have the tiniest flirtation with another man when i was as good as engaged to the creature
but she would tell me that i ought to be thankful to have the chance of making such a good match the creature is rich
as if i cared how clever or rich he is
beatrix made me so cross that i gave up saying anything and sulked by myself
the creature is on his way out to canada now
ive been too much taken up with my own feelings to worry about his
he must loathe and detest the very thought of me
what do you suppose he does think of it all
you ought to understand the man's part of it better than i can
she becomes his boyish ideal of all that is good and true
the thought of her abides with him as a safeguard and an inspiration
for her sake he resolves to make the most of himself
when she comes to him she must find his heart fit to receive her
if he thought so but no i am sure he doesn't
he's just coming out here like a martyr going to the stake
he knows he will be expected to propose to me when he gets here
he knows and i know that i will be expected to say my very prettiest yes
i came out here this afternoon and thought the whole affair over from beginning to end
if you were to like him a little better than you expect
it would be awkward to have committed yourself by a rash vow to saying no
it's just as well to be on the safe side
the rain was over and the sun was coming out through the mists
so ill just resolve that i will say no if i don't want to say yes
thank you so much for letting me tell you all about it
he stood on the pavilion and watched the girl out of sight beyond the pines
when the girl got home she was told that the dalhousie team had won the game
the girl dragged her hat off and waved it joyously
that i relieved my mind to that young man out in the park today
if i had come back with all that pentup feeling seething within me and heard this news right on top of it all
the creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones
when the girl went down to meet the creature she found herself confronted by the young man
but her family thought her confusion very natural and pretty
they really had not expected her to behave so well
aunt cyrilla's christmas basket when lucy rose met aunt cyrilla coming downstairs
somewhat flushed and breathless from her ascent to the garret
lucy rose had done her brave best for some years in fact
only laughed at what she called lucy rose's finicky notions
haunting idea that it was extremely provincial for her aunt always to take the big basket
felt chagrined over this all of which goes to prove that lucy was as yet very young and had a great deal to learn in this world
that troublesome worry over what geraldine would think nerved her to make a protest in this instance
youre surely not going to take that funny old basket to pembroke this time christmas day and all
as she put it on the table and proceeded to dust it out
i never went to see edward and geraldine since they were married that i didn't take a basket of good things along with me for them
edward is always real glad to get some of the old farmhouse goodies
i don't see that it's anything to be ashamed of
but just now it is giving you a lot of trouble
it does look so funny to be walking through the streets with that big
edward and geraldine don't need it i know that but there may be those that will
if it hurts your feelings to walk longside of a countrified old lady with a countrified basket
tapping the snowy kitchen table with the point of her plump
that big fruit cake for one thing edward does like my fruit cake and that cold boiled tongue for another
theyd spoil before we got back or your uncled make himself sick eating them mince pie is his besetting sin
that little stone bottle full of cream geraldine may carry any amount of style
but ive yet to see her look down on real good country cream
that plate of jelly cookies and doughnuts will please the children and fill up the chinks
you can bring me that box of icecream candy out of the pantry
that bag of striped candy sticks your uncle brought home from the corner last night
of course three or four dozen of those good eaters and a little pot of my greengage preserves edwardll like that
some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves
the presents for the children can go in on top
there's a doll for daisy and the little boat your uncle made for ray and a tatted lace handkerchief apiece for the twins
the pig uncle leo killed is hanging up in the porch
i guess well leave the pig alone but since you have reminded me of it
not having been trained under aunt cyrilla's eye for nothing
but when aunt cyrilla had put in as a finishing touch a big bouquet of pink and white everlastings
lucy rose stood over the basket and whispered vindictively some day im going to burn this basket when i get courage enough
then therell be an end of lugging it everywhere we go like a like an old marketwoman
he was not going to spend christmas with edward and geraldine
perhaps the prospect of having to cook and eat his christmas dinner all alone made him pessimistic
but lucy rose got up three times in the night to see if it were storming
when she did sleep had horrible nightmares of struggling through blinding snowstorms dragging aunt cyrilla's christmas basket along with her
uncle leopold drove aunt cyrilla and lucy rose and the basket to the station
when they reached there the air was thick with flying flakes
the stationmaster sold them their tickets with a grim face
there's been so much snow already that traffic is blocked half the time
now there ain't no place to shovel the snow off onto
aunt cyrilla said that if the train were to get to pembroke in time for christmas
it would get there and she opened her basket and gave the stationmaster and three small boys an apple apiece
when their train came along aunt cyrilla established herself in one seat and her basket in another
these were few in number a delicate little woman at the end of the car
a sunburned lad three seats ahead in a khaki uniform
imposing old lady in a sealskin coat ahead of him
maybe and that young chap must be one of the boys not long out of the hospital
that woman's children look as if they hadn't enjoyed a square meal since they were born and if that girl across from me has a mother
letting her daughter go from home in this weather in clothes like that
lucy rose merely wondered uncomfortably what the others thought of aunt cyrilla's basket
but as the day wore on the storm grew worse
twice the train had to stop while the train hands dug it out
it was dusk when the conductor came through the train
impossible to go on or back track blocked for miles what's that
these storms of late have played the mischief with everything
aunt cyrilla took some apples and striped candy sticks from her basket and carried them to them
she lifted the oldest into her ample lap and soon had them all around her
the rest of the travellers straggled over to the corner and drifted into conversation
the khaki boy said it was hard lines not to get home for christmas
reached halifax three days ago and telegraphed the old folks id eat my christmas dinner with them
to have an extrabig turkey because i didn't have any last year
he looked as if he wanted to cry but thought better of it and bit off a mouthful of candy
pretty girl came up and took the baby from the tired mother
im just a shop girl out of work at present
aunt cyrilla went to her basket and took out her box of cream candy
let's eat it all up and have a good time
father wrote to me last week and asked me to let bygones be bygones and come home for christmas
it seems too bad that we are not to get there
i have to be back at work the morning after christmas
the khaki boy came up again and shared the candy
even the sealskin lady turned her head over her shoulder
one on aunt cyrilla's lap and one on lucy rose's
aunt cyrilla and the pale girl helped the mother make up beds for them
the minister gave his overcoat and the sealskin lady came forward with a shawl
we must get up some santa claus for these youngsters
let's hang their stockings on the wall and fillem up as best we can
ive nothing about me but some hard cash and a jackknife
ill give each ofem a quarter and the boy can have the knife
she had fallen asleep with her head against the seatback
ive some presents in it that i was taking to my nephew's children
i think the mother is the one for it to go to
let's make up a little purse among us for a christmas present
when aunt cyrilla straightened it out she saw that it was for twenty dollars
she smiled at aunt cyrilla as she lugged it down the aisle and aunt cyrilla smiled back
lucy rose had never touched that basket of her own accord before
the twins lace handkerchiefs to the two smaller girls and the hood to the baby
then the stockings were filled up with doughnuts and jelly cookies and the money was put in an envelope and pinned to the little mother's jacket
aunt cyrilla put her hand over the lady's kid glove
afterwards they rested from their labours and all had what aunt cyrilla called a snack of sandwiches and pound cake
the khaki boy said he hadn't tasted anything half so good since he left home
the children wakened and went wild with delight over their stockings
the little mother found her envelope and tried to utter thanks and broke down and nobody knew what to say or do
when the conductor fortunately came in and made a diversion by telling them they might as well resign themselves to spending christmas on the train
there's plenty for all and well have our christmas dinner
lucy rose gave three recitations and the minister a comic reading
it was agreed that the khaki boy's whistling solo was the best number
aunt cyrilla gave him the bouquet of everlastings as a reward of merit
then the conductor came in with the cheerful news that the storm was almost over and he thought the track would be cleared in a few hours
if we can get to the next station well be all right
the branch joins the main line there and the tracks will be clear
the minister carved the chicken with the brakeman's jackknife and the khaki boy cut up the tongue and the mince pies
while the sealskin lady mixed the raspberry vinegar with its due proportion of water
a tin pint cup was discovered and given to the children
aunt cyrilla and lucy rose and the sealskin lady drank
the shop girl and the little mother shared one of the empty bottles
everybody declared they had never enjoyed a meal more in their lives
the bones of the chicken and the pot of preserves were all that was left
they could not eat the preserves because they had no spoons
a hearty vote of thanks was passed to aunt cyrilla and her basket
the sealskin lady wanted to know how she made her pound cake
the khaki boy asked for her receipt for jelly cookies
when two hours later the conductor came in and said the snowploughs had got along and theyd soon be starting
they all wondered if it could really be less than twentyfour hours since they met
i feel as if id been campaigning with you all my life
the little mother and the children had to take the next train back home
this has been the pleasantest christmas i have ever spent
when aunt cyrilla and lucy rose reached pembroke there was nobody to meet them because everyone had given up expecting them
it was not far from the station to edward's house and aunt cyrilla elected to walk
please forget all the silly things i ever said about it
we had been passing the time by telling ghost stories
that is a very good sort of thing for a rainy afternoon
if you tell ghost stories after dark they are apt to make you nervous
so that you can't fancy there is anything behind you
had had the usual assortment of mysterious noises and death warnings and sheeted spectres and so on
down through the whole catalogue of horrors enough to satisfy any reasonable ghosttaster
i never expect to get so far along as to see a real ghost myself
but i would like to see and talk to one who had
some persons appear to have the knack of getting their wishes granted
volunteered to tell a ghost story himself something that had happened to his grandmother
it was a very good ghost story as ghost stories go
then there would be no use in my saying it
ive never been able to explain it from a practical point of view
i don't suppose any of you have ever heard me speak of my brother
when he left college he became engaged to dorothy chester
she died a short time before the date set for their marriage
but our eldest daughter was strikingly like her dead aunt
when dolly was twelve years old charles went to new orleans on business
that very morning my wife and dolly had gone to new york en route for europe
dolly was going to school in paris for a year
business prevented my accompanying them even as far as new york
they were to sail on the aragon the next morning
was on the point of lighting a cigar when an unaccountable impulse made me turn round
i dropped my cigar and sprang to my feet in amazement
there was only one door in the room and i had all along been facing it
was a man and that man was my brother charles
there was no mistaking him i saw him as plainly as i see you
he wore the same lightgrey suit which he had worn when bidding us goodbye on the morning of his departure for new orleans
i want you to understand that at this precise moment
because i did not for a moment suppose that what i saw was well
the thought that flashed across my bewildered brain was simply that there had been some absurd mistake somewhere
i was quite close to him when i stopped abruptly
i know it is a very conventional way of ending up a ghost story
one moment he was there and the next moment he wasn't
he did not pass me or go out of the door
i was wide awake and in my right and proper senses so far as i could judge
in my mental confusion one thought stood out sharply dolly was in danger of some kind
having first wired to my wife not to sail on the aragon
i found that i could connect with the fivefifteen train for new york
i took it with the comfortable consciousness that my friends would certainly think i had gone out of my mind
i arrived in new york at eight o'clock the next morning and at once drove to the hotel where my wife
gilbert laughed at me and said i had dreamed the whole thing
gilbert had to give in to this decision with a very bad grace
the aragon sailed that day minus three of her intended passengers
youve all heard of the historic collision between the aragon and the astarte in a fog
virginia and dolly sailed a month later on the marseilles
boys the only experience of the kind i ever had
we had many questions to ask and several theories to advance
jack said davenport had dreamed it and that the collision of the aragon and the astarte was simply a striking coincidence
emily's husband emily fair got out of hiram jameson's waggon at the gate
it was very sweet always and very cold generally sometimes it softened to tenderness with those she loved
but in it there was always an undertone of inflexibility and reserve
she had been furious under all her external composure because he had been at the station when she left the train
if stephen fair don't get better shell be free and then he did not round out the thought
emily stood at the gate for some time after jameson's waggon had disappeared
when the brief burst of sunset splendour had faded out she turned and went into the garden where late asters and chrysanthemums still bloomed
she gathered some of the more perfect ones here and there
for she presently dropped those she had gathered and deliberately set her foot on them
sodden fields and the ragged maples around the garden writhed and wailed
the rain that had threatened all day was very near
she came forward and took emily's parcels and wraps with a certain gentleness that sat oddly on her grim personality
hiram jameson was there and offered to drive me home
the light flared up as she spoke and brought out her strong
amelia had expected that hiram jameson would have told her
the older sister knew that beneath that surface reserve was a passionate nature
brooking no restraint when once it overleaped the bounds of her puritan selfcontrol
with all her naturally keen insight and her acquired knowledge of emily's character
had never been able to fathom the latter's attitude of mind towards her husband
from the time that emily had come back to her girlhood's home
i suppose you haven't heard that stephen is very ill
only in her voice when she spoke was a curious jarring
as if a false note had been struck in a silver melody
she felt relieved that emily had taken it so calmly
amelia hated stephen fair with all the intensity of her nature because she believed that he had treated emily ill
but she had always been distrustful that emily in her heart of hearts loved her husband still
with a sudden recurrence of the untuneful note is he dangerously ill
wraithlike change of expression drifted over emily's beautiful face and was gone in a moment
when she next spoke her vibrant voice was as perfectly melodious as usual
in the dark hall emily paused for a moment and opened the front door to be cut in the face with a whiplike dash of rain
the wind around the manycornered old farmhouse was full of wails and sobs
she remembered that she had been married at eight o'clock that very morning seven years ago
she thought she could see herself coming down the stairs in her white dress with her bouquet of asters
for a moment she was glad that those mocking flowers in the garden would be all beaten to death before morning by the lash of wind and rain
when she had put out her light and gone to bed she found that she could not sleep
she pretended to believe that it was the noise of the storm that kept her awake
not even to herself would emily confess that she was waiting and listening nervously for john's return home
every few minutes a gust of wind smote the house
in the silences that came between the gusts she heard the soft
steady pouring of the rain on the garden paths below
mingled with a faint murmur that came up from the creek beyond the barns where the pine boughs were thrashing in the storm
as of a man who counted for nothing in her life
it was so strange to think of stephen being ill
she had never known him to have a day's sickness in his life before
she looked back over her life much as if she were glancing with a chill interest at a series of pictures which in no way concerned her
had filled the vacant place so well and with such intuitive tenderness that emily had never been conscious of missing a mother
woodford people were fond of saying that john and amelia spoiled emily shamefully
emily phillips had never been like the other woodford girls and had no friends of her own age among them
but she had never cared for any of them until stephen fair
there was an ancient feud between the families that had died out among the younger generation
she had cared for him long before the memorable day when he had first looked at her with seeing eyes and realized that the quiet
unthoughtof child who had been growing up at the old phillips place had blossomed out into a woman of strange
seraphlike beauty and deep grey eyes whose expression was nevermore to go out of stephen fair's remembrance from then till the day of his death
john and amelia phillips put their own unjustifiable dislike of stephen aside when they found that emily's heart was set on him
the two were married after a brief courtship and emily went out from her girlhood's home to the fair homestead
she had not been willing for stephen to marry her
ineradicable love of making mischief and took a keen pleasure in it
she loved her son and she had loved her husband
when thomas fair had been alive she had fomented continual strife and discontent between him and stephen
now it became her pleasure to make what trouble she could between stephen and his wife
she had the advantage of emily in that she was always sweetspoken and
so subtle that they were beyond a man's courser comprehension
astonished her husband by her fierce outbursts of anger that seemed to him for the most part without reason or excuse
he tried his best to preserve the peace between his wife and mother and when he failed
not understanding all that emily really endured at the elder woman's merciless hands
he grew to think her capricious and easily irritated a spoiled child whose whims must not be taken too seriously
the unbroken indulgence which her brother and sister had always accorded her had fitted her but poorly to cope with the trials of her new life
but if emily had chosen to be more patient under petty insults
less resentful of her husband's wellmeant though clumsy efforts for harmony
told her husband that she would no longer live in the same house with his mother
her splendid voice vibrating with all the unleashed emotion of her being
was angry with the relentless anger of a patient man roused at last
ill never turn my mother from my door for any woman's whim
leave my house if you will if you hold your marriage vow so lightly
when your senses return you are welcome to come back to me
they hated stephen fair with a new and personal rancour
the one thing they could hardly have forgiven emily would have been the fact of her relenting towards him
since their separation no greeting or look had ever passed between husband and wife
in her pride and anger she would not let herself remember even where she had dug its grave
the strange woman felt a certain pride in her own inflexibility because the fact did not affect her
she told herself that she could not have felt more unconcerned had he been the merest stranger
at ten o'clock she heard his voice in the kitchen
she leaned out of the bed and pulled open her door
so she rose and went noiselessly out into the hall
the door of the kitchen was open below her and a narrow shaft of light struck on her white
she looked like a woman waiting for the decree of doom
then the latter said abruptly did you hear how stephen fair was
she gripped the square rails with her hands until the sharp edges dinted deep into her fingers
harsh and expressionless he took a bad turn the day before yesterday and has been getting worse ever since
she got up and went blindly back into her room with such agony tearing at her heartstrings that she dully wondered why she could not shriek aloud
in the burning anguish of that moment her own soul was as an open book before her
the love she had buried rose from the deeps of her being in an awful
out of her stupor and pain a purpose formed itself clearly
she must go to stephen she must beg and win his forgiveness before it was too late
she dared not go down to john and ask him to take her to her husband
the phillipses had been known to do even harder things than that
at the best there would be a storm of protest and objection on her brother's and sister's part
emily felt that she could not encounter that in her present mood
she wrapped herself in a heavy woollen shawl hanging in the hall and crept downstairs
with numbed fingers she fumbled at the key of the hall door
the storm seemed to reach out and clutch her and swallow her up
where the flowers already were crushed to earth she crossed the long field beyond
where the rain cut her face like a whip and the wind almost twisted her in its grasp like a broken reed
she found the path that led through commons and woods and waste valleys to her lost home
in after years that frenzied walk through the storm and blackness seemed as an unbroken nightmare to emily fair's recollection
dead limb of fir struck her forehead and cut in it a gash that marked her for life
as she struggled to her feet and found her way again the blood trickled down over her face
don't let him die before i get to him don't don't don't
she prayed desperately with more of defiance than entreaty in her voice
surely some fearsome punishment would come upon her for her wickedness she would find her husband lying dead
when emily opened the kitchen door of the fair homestead almira sentner cried out in her alarm
who or what was this creature with the white face and wild eyes
windwrithen hair and the big drops of blood slowly trickling from her brow
the next moment she recognized emily and her face hardened
the doctors won't allow anyone in the room but those he's used to
the insolence and cruelty of her speech fell on unheeding ears
she said in a voice that was little more than a thrilling whisper
but which yet had in it something that cowed almira sentner's malice
sullenly she stood aside and emily went unhindered up the stairs to the room where the sick man lay
emily pushed them aside and fell on her knees by the bed
one of the doctors made a hasty motion as if to draw her back
emily drew his head close to her face and kissed his lips passionately
she buried her face in the pillow beside his with a sob
grey light of the autumn dawn the old doctor came to the bedside and lifted emily to her feet
now she raised her white face with dumb pleading in her eyes
the doctor glanced at the sleeping form on the bed
his joy turned the ebbing tide in favour of life
for the first time in her life her beautiful voice trembled
a light snow had fallen in the night and the landscape
was as white and lifeless as if wrapped in a shroud
a young man was driving down the road to rykman's corner the youthful face visible above the greatcoat was thoughtful and refined
the chill breathlessness of the air seemed prophetic of more snow
the reverend allan telford looked across the bare wastes and cold white hills and shivered
as if the icy lifelessness about him were slowly and relentlessly creeping into his own heart and life
in his soul he was asking bitterly what good had come of all his prayerful labours among the people of this pinched
as rugged and unbeautiful in form and life as the barren hills that shut them in
he had been two years among them and he counted it two years of failure
he had been too outspoken for them they resented sullenly his direct and incisive tirades against their pet sins
they viewed his small innovations on their traditional ways of worship with disfavour and distrust and shut him out of their lives with an everincreasing coldness
he had meant well and worked hard and he felt his failure keenly
his thoughts reverted to a letter received the preceding day from a former classmate
fresh from college and full of vigorous enthusiasm and high ideas
my work must lie among the poor and lowly of earth as did my master's
i fear i shall sink down into something almost as pitiful as one of these canting
i can do them no good they do not like or trust me
i will accept this call and go back to my own world
perhaps the keynote of his failure was sounded in his last words
it was some lower level to which he had come with good tidings and honest intentions but
rykman's corner came into view as he drove over the brow of a long hill
knowing it well for what it was a festering hotbed of gossip and malice
the habitat of all the slanderous rumours and innuendoes that permeated the social tissue of the community
a man came out of a small house at the foot and waited on the road
had it been possible telford would have pretended not to see him
for isaac galletly meant to be seen and hailed the minister cheerfully
ye won't mind giving me a lift down to the corner
telford checked his horse reluctantly and galletly crawled into the cutter
he spent most of his time travelling from house to house in the village
smoking his pipe in neighbourly kitchens and fanning into an active blaze all the smouldering feuds of the place
he had been nicknamed the morning chronicle by a sarcastic schoolteacher who had sojourned a winter at the corner
i suppose he is starting out on his rounds now
that was a grand sermon ye gave us last sunday
live peaceably with all men that's what i lay out to do
there ain't a house in the district but what i can drop into and welcome
galletly squinted out of the corner of his eye to see if the minister would open on the trail of this hint
telford's passive face was discouraging but galletly was not to be baffled
i s pose ye haven't heard about the row down at palmers last night
telford was vainly seeking to nip galletly's gossip in the bud
the name of palmer conveyed no especial meaning to his ear
whose name wasmistress fuller and who came to church occasionally
he had called three times and found nobody at home at least
now he was fated to have the whole budget of some vulgar quarrel forced on him by galletly
the long and short of it is that min palmer has had a regular upanddown row with rose fuller and turned her and her little gal out of doors
min's a tartar when her temper's up and that's pretty often
nobody knows how rose managed to put up with her so long
she hasn't a cent nor a relation she was just an orphan girl that palmer brought up
but he understood thatmistress fuller was in trouble of some kind and that it was his duty to help her if possible
although he had an odd and unaccountable aversion to the woman
if i am to be of any service but i have no wish to hear idle gossip
min palmer's the worst woman in rykman's corner or out of it
i mind her when she was a girl a saucy
her people were a queer crowd and min was never brung up right jest let run wild all her life
old palmer was well off and rod was his only child
but this rose lived there and kept house for them after mis palmer died
folks said the old man wanted rod to marry her dunno ift was so or not
old palmer was furious but he had to give in and rod brought her home
she was a bit sobered down by her trouble and lived quiet and sullenlike at first
he died in a year or so and left rose and her baby without a roof over their heads
he set great store by rose and he c dn't bear min
min had to be civil to rose as long as old palmer lived
fin lly rod up and died andt wasn't long before his father went too
everyone expected that hed purvide well for rose and mind come in second best
hed have a lawyer out from town every year and have a new will made and the old one burnt
lawyer bell was there and made one bout eight months fore he died
it was s posed hed destroyed it and then died fore hed time to make another
everything went to min's child to min as ye might say
min's in one of her tantrums now and tain't safe to cross her path
she's sickly can't work much and then she has her leetle gal
smart leetle creetur and old palmer made a lot of it
min's own is an awfullooking thing a cripple from the timet was born
no doubt the god of the widow and fatherless will purvide for her
i think i had better call and see thismistress palmer
mind slam the door in your face if she did nothing worse
mister telford he didn't hold no truck with evildoers he went right to her to reprove and rebuke her for her sins
people hereabouts has talked to her and tried to do her good
the last one he was about your heft he got a scare
min just caught him by the shoulder and shook him like a rat
he felt that he could not endure this man's society any longer
this min palmer must at least be different from the rest of the cornerites
he almost felt as if her sins on the grand scale were less blameworthy than the petty vices of her censorious neighbours
galletly eagerly joined the group of loungers on the dirty wet platform
a couple of slatternly women were talking tomistress rykman about the palmer row
he came face to face with a woman who had paused in the doorway to survey the scene with an air of sullen scorn
by some subtle intuition telford knew that this was min palmer
the young man's first feeling was one of admiration for the woman before him
not even the man's ragged overcoat which she wore could conceal the grace of her figure
her abundant black hair was twisted into a sagging knot at her neck
from beneath the old fur cap looked out a pair of large and brilliant black eyes
but the warm crimson blood glowed in her cheeks with a dusky richness
looking out from behind this external mask of degraded beauty
the semblance of what this woman might have been under more favouring circumstance of birth and environment
might have been trained and swayed aright until it had developed grandly out into the glorious womanhood the creator must have planned for her
that this woman had nothing in common with the narrow
she was yet far nobler than those who sat in judgement upon her
min made some scanty purchases and left the store quickly
he saw her step on a rough woodsleigh and drive down the river road
telford was sick at heart as he drove swiftly away
he felt for min palmer a pity he could not understand or analyze
the attempt to measure the gulf between what she was and what she might have been hurt him like the stab of a knife
he made several calls at various houses along the river during the forenoon
after dinner he suddenly turned his horse towards the palmer place
he's a set one when he does take a notion
telford was not without his own misgivings as he drove into the palmer yard
he tied his horse to the fence and looked doubtfully about him
so he turned towards the kitchen and walked slowly past the bare lilac trees along the fence
the hills and river were hidden behind a misty white veil
the door was flung open and min herself confronted him on the threshold
she did not now have on the man's overcoat which she had worn at the store
her splendid hair was braided about her head in a glossy coronet
again telford was overcome by a sense of her wonderful loveliness
not all the years of bondage to illtemper and misguided will had been able to blot out the beauty of that proud
she lifted one large but shapely brown hand and pointed to the gate
i suppose some of the corner saints set you on me
slowly the fire and anger faded out of her face and her head drooped
maybe you mean well but you can't do me any good
i came to help you if i could if you needed help
she flung out her hands as if pushing some loathly
i hate the name as i hated all who ever bore it
i never had anything but wrong and dogusage from them all
call me min that's the only name that belongs to me now
telford threw back his head and looked once more into her eyes
a bitter sense of defeat and disappointment filled his heart as he drove away
min stood in the doorway and watched the sleigh out of sight down the river road
as if groping vaguely in some hitherto unsounded depth of consciousness
he could have helped me if we had met in time
swaying her body to and fro as one in mortal agony
how the corner saints would stare if they saw me
i suppose some of them do with a glance at the windows of a neighbouring house
there'smistress rawlings staring out and rose peeking over her shoulder
she was a sweetspoken cat of a thing but she had claws
id tell that minister how she used to twit and taunt me in that sugary way of hers how she schemed and plotted against me as long as she could
id go and drown myself at that black springhole down there id be well out of the way
it was a dull grey afternoon a week afterwards when allan telford again walked up the river road to the palmer place
the wind was bitter and he walked with bent head to avoid its fury
his face was pale and worn and he looked years older
he paused at the rough gate and leaned over it while he scanned the house and its surroundings eagerly
he saw her lead a horse from the stable and harness it into a woodsleigh loaded with bags of grain
once she paused to fling her arms about the animal's neck
unwomanly toil and fold her safely away from jeers and scorn in the shelter of his love
he knew it was madness he had told himself so every hour in which min's dark
rebellious face had haunted him yet none the less was he under its control
min led the horse across the yard and left it standing before the kitchen door she had not seen the bowed figure at the gate
he saw her dark eyes and the rosered lustre of her face gleam out from under the old crimson shawl wrapped about her head
min lost her foothold and fell directly under the horse's hoofs as they came heavily down
telford sprang over the gate and rushed up the slope like a madman
he lifted her in his arms and staggered into the house with his burden
his heart stilling with a horrible fear as he laid her gently down on the old lounge in one corner of the kitchen
the room was a large one and everything was neat and clean
a few green plants were in blossom by the south window
beside them sat a child of about seven years who turned a startled face at telford's reckless entrance
the boy had min's dark eyes and perfectly chiselled features
with satin ears and paws fringed as with ravelled silk
striving tremblingly to feel her pulse while cold drops came out on his forehead
save for one heavy bruise across the cheek and a cruel cut at the edge of the dark hair
telford sprang to his feet in a tumult of quivering joy
i must leave you for a minute while i run for help i will not be long
don't you go one step don't leave me here to die alone
im past help and ive something to say to you
he knelt beside her and put his arm about the poor
there was a will he made it old gran'ther palmer
he left everything to her not a cent to me nor his son's child we were to starve beg
it's tortured me night and day ive had no peace
rose hates him shell turn him out or illtreat him telford lifted his white
an expression of unspeakable relief came into the dying woman's face
im glad to die to get clear of it all
once again min opened her eyes and looked straight into his
if i had met you long ago you would have loved me and i would have been a good woman
it is well for us for you that i am dying
your path will be clear you will be good and successful but you will always remember me
telford bent and pressed his lips to min's painblanched mouth
out there it's so dark god can never forgive me ive been so wicked
i will stay here and do my duty i will try hard his voice broke
min's great black eyes beamed out on him with passionate tenderness
who shall say that her remorseful cry was not heard
holding in his arms the dead form of the woman he loved his
to min's face had returned something of its girlhood's innocence
with the silky head of the dog pressed against his cheek
telford gathered the distorted little body to his side and looked earnestly into the small face min's face
the closed eyelids and the bloodstained brow of the dead woman
allan telford sat in the study of his little manse among the encircling wintry hills
i shall see it every time i look from my study window every time i stand in my pulpit every time i go in and out among my people
he closed the book and bowed his head on it
outside the snow fell softly he knew that it was wrapping that newmade grave on the cold
firsentinelled hillside with a stainless shroud of infinite purity and peace
in her car ride from the school where she taught to the bridge that spanned the river between pottstown
playing and quarrelling on the streets or peering wistfully out of dingy tenement windows
theyve no better place to play in than the back streets and yards
im so sorry for them it hurts me to look at them
because she realized that she was turning her back upon pottstown for two blissful days and going to point pleasant
elmshaded street hedging on oldfashioned gardens and cosy little houses and trailing off into the real country in a halfhour's walk
miss cordelia lived alone in a tiny house at point pleasant
it was so tiny that you would have wondered how anyone could live in it
but it's plenty big for a little old maid like me
there's solid comfort in having one spot for your own self
if i had less land and more house it would be better
the field was of no use to miss cordelia she didn't keep a cow and she hadn't time to make a garden
but she liked her field when people asked her why she didn't sell it she said im fond of it
i like to walk around in it when the grass grows long
mother used to say if you kept anything seven years it would come to use
ive had my field a good bit longer than that
meanwhile i rejoice in the fact that i am a landed proprietor to the extent of four acres
miss cordelia had thought of converting her field into a playground for the factory children and asking detachments of them over on saturday afternoon
but she knew that her point pleasant neighbours would object to this
hung crookedly in a very compact and prim spruce hedge
who lived on the other side of the spruce hedge
i have a letter that was left with me for you
tied at my front door and he's eaten the tops off every one of my geraniums
tied by a halter to the elm at miss cordelia's door and contentedly munching a mouthful of geranium stalks
same boy brought it as brought the horse a little freckly chap mostly all grin and shirtsleeves
said he was told to take the letter and horse to miss cordelia herry
so he tied the creature in there and left the letter with me
he has played havoc with your geraniums and no mistake
when she finished it she looked at the curious cynthia ann solemnly
i suspected he was at the bottom of it as soon as i laid my eyes on that animal
he's been living out at poplar valley and he writes me that he has gone out west
so he wants me to take him and be kind to him for old times sake
john and i were just like brother and sister when we were children
he was always doing odd things and thinking they were all right
if it were a cat or a dog but a horse
but you don't really mean that youre going to keep the horse
he is no good to you and think of the expense of feeding him
although this is as crazy as anything he ever did
miss cordelia always adapted herself quickly and calmly to new circumstances
it is never any use to get in a stew about things
where she tied him safely to a post with such an abundance of knots that there was small fear of his getting away
when the mystified cynthia ann had returned home miss cordelia set about getting her tea and thinking over the plan that had come to her concerning her white elephant
ill have to dispose of him in the fall for ive no place to keep him in
ill see if i can borrow mister griggs's express wagon for saturday afternoons
if i can those poor factory children in my grade shall have a weekly treat or my name is not cordelia herry
im not so sure but that john drew has done a good thing after all
all the point pleasant people soon knew about miss cordelia's questionable windfall
she listened to all tranquilly and then placidly followed her own way
mister griggs was very obliging in regard to his old express wagon
the next saturday point pleasant was treated to a mild sensation nothing less than miss cordelia rattling through the village
enthroned on the high seat of mister griggs's yellow express wagon
after a week of browsing idleness in the fouracre field
was quite frisky and went at a decided amble down elm street and across the bridge
the long wagon had been filled up with board seats
when miss cordelia came back over the bridge the boards were crowded with factory children palefaced little creatures whose eyes were aglow with pleasure at this unexpected outing
miss cordelia drove straight out to the big pineclad hills of deepdale
then she tied nap in a convenient lane and turned the children loose to revel in the woods and fields
when dinner time came she gathered them all around her and went to the wagon
in it she had a basket of bread and butter
but they must have something to stay their little stomachs
miss cordelia had had her eye on a certain farmhouse all the morning
she did not know anything about the people who lived there
they all trooped into the great farmhouse yard just as a big man stepped out of a nearby barn
miss cordelia thought she had never seen anybody so much like an incarnate smile before
smiles of all kinds seemed literally to riot over his ruddy face and in and out of his eyes and around the corners of his mouth
these are a lot of factory children ive brought out for a saturday treat
i thought i might get some water from your well
maybe you will lend us a tin dipper or two
all of you come over to the lawn and make yourselves at home
in spite of my naturally cantankerous disposition but come this way
i can see the hunger sticking out of those youngsters eyes
well have a sort of impromptu picnic here and now
ill tell my housekeeper to send out some jam too
while the children devoured their lunch miss cordelia found herself telling mister smiles all about old nap and her little project
im going to bring out a load every fine saturday all summer
some of them here never saw green fields before today
mister smiles listened and beamed and twinkled until miss cordelia felt almost as dazzled as if she were looking at the sun
i like this plan of yours and i want to have a hand in helping it along
turn them loose in my beech woods and upland pastures
ill put up some swings for them and have some games
im fond of children even if i am a grumpy crossgrained old bachelor
if you can give up your own holiday to give them a good time
happy little lads and lasses ambled back to town in the golden dusk she felt that the expedition had been an emphatic success
even old nap seemed to jog along eyedeep in satisfaction
probably he was ruminating on the glorious afternoon he had spent in mister smiles's clover pasture
every fine saturday that summer miss cordelia took some of the factory children to the country
the point pleasant people nicknamed her equipage miss cordelia's accommodation
but when the big bronze and golden leaves began to fall in the beech woods
miss cordelia sorrowfully realized that the summer was over and that the weekly outings which she had enjoyed as much as the children must soon be discontinued
it will soon be too cold for our jaunts and of course i can't keep nap through the winter
miss cordelia looked at him and was amazed to see that not a smile was on or about his face
i think id like to be a cross old husband
do you think you could put up with me in that capacity
miss cordelia gave a half gasp and then she had to laugh
the smiles at once broke loose and revelled over her wooer's face
at new year's miss cordelia was to leave her school and sooty pottstown and come to be mistress of beechwood farm
drive into town for some children and bring them out here for their weekly treat as usual
if it isn't there are the barns for the overflow
this is going to be our particular pet charity all our lives
said miss cordelia with a happy light in her eyes
he shall live in clover for the rest of his days
ned i can give you a lift if youre going my way
with a glance at the skates that were hanging over ned's shoulder
pretty hard lines when boys have to go six miles for a skate
you know old dutcher won't allow a boy to set foot there
he says they would knock down his fences climbing over them
i heard a rumour to the effect that you are soon going to take a course at the business college in trenton
aunt ella has very kindly offered to board me free for the term
ive cudgelled my brains for the past month trying to think of some way
perhaps youll hit on some plan yet to earn that money
it will prove that you have good stuff in you
a quiet little farming village in winter isn't exactly a promising field for financial operations
at winterby corners ned found a crowd of boys waiting for him
was grumbling because they had to go all the way to windsor to skate
like as not well get into a free fight with the windsorites when we get there
the rivalry which existed between the carleton and the windsor boys was bitter and of long standing
we ought to be able to hold our own tonight
if we could only get old dutcher to let us skate on his pond
id give a lot if we could only go there
the next day ned allen went down to see mister dutcher
ned did not exactly look forward to the interview with pleasure
old dutcher was a crank there was no getting around that fact
ned had no reason to hope that this would be one
this poor lady had a decidedly lonely life of it
his passion for solitude was surpassed only by his eagerness to make and save money
was the terror of all who had ever had dealings with him
this did turn out to be one of old dutcher's good days
he had just concluded an advantageous bargain with a windsor cattledealer
he disliked ned less than the rest because the boy had always treated him respectfully and had never played any tricks on him on hallowe'en or april fool's day
ive come down to see you on a little matter of business
it never did to beat about the bush with old dutcher you had to come straight to the point
i want to know if you will rent your pond behind the barn to me for a skatingrink
i ain't going to rent that pond for no skatingrink
i want you to hear my proposition before you refuse definitely
ill give you ten dollars for the rent of the pond then ill see that there will be no running over your fields and climbing your fences
my rink will be open only from two to six in the afternoon and from seven to ten in the evening
during that time i shall always be at the pond to keep everything in order
the skaters will come and go by the lane leading from the barn to the road
the carleton boys wouldn't patronize a rink run by you
it did not displease him to know that the carleton boys hated him
you couldn't be on the pond for eight hours a day and until ten o'clock at night
i wouldn't have to be trying to make money by a skatingrink
he knew very well that he could not run a rink by himself
by the next day he had placards out in conspicuous places on the schoolhouse
at winterby corners announcing that he had rented mister dutcher's pond for a skatingrink
that tickets for the same at twentyfive cents a week for each skater could be had upon application to him
ned was not long left in doubt as to the success of his enterprise
at first ned had some trouble with two or three rowdies
by old dutcher's reputation and by the public opinion of the other boys
at the end of the season ned paid old dutcher his ten dollars
had plenty left to pay for books and tuition at the business college in trenton
my bookkeeper will be leaving me about the time you will be through at the college
i will be wanting in his place a young man with a good nose for business
i rather think that you will be that young man
a position in mister rogers's store meant good salary and promotion
he had never dared to hope for such good fortune
if you think i can give satisfaction you manipulated old dutcher
youve earned enough in a very slowgoing place to put you through your businesscollege term
so i am sure you are the man im looking for
i believe in helping those who have gumption enough to help themselves
our runaway kite of course there was nobody for us to play with on the big half moon
we just had to make the most of each other
we are father and claude and i and aunt esther and mimi and dick
it used to be only father and claude and i
it is all on account of the kite that there are more of us
father is the keeper of the big half moon lighthouse
he has always been the keeper ever since i can remember
there isn't any need of a light on the big half moon
claude and mimi and dick and i go to school
so glad that we don't know what to do with ourselves
the funny part used to be that people always pitied us when the time came for us to return
he makes the very best pirate chief i ever saw
but he can never roar out his orders in the bloodcurdling tones that claude can
of course claude and i would have liked to have someone to play with us
because it is hard to run pirate caves and things like that with only two
but we used to quarrel a good deal with the mainland children in winter
so perhaps it was just as well that there were none of them on the big half moon
when i saw claude getting too excited i gave in to him
they have to be humoured they are not like girls
what did we need with a woman when we had father
he could cook all we wanted to eat and make molasses taffy that was just like a dream
he used to hear our lessons and tell us splendid stories and saw that we always said our prayers
claude and i wouldn't have done anything to make him feel bad for the world
we thought it would be so jolly to have an uncle and aunt and some cousins
but he looked so sorrowful all of a sudden that we wished we hadn't
but i never said anything more about it to father
it is always lovely out here on the big half moon in summer
when it is fine the harbour is blue and calm
the mainland shores look like long blue lands where fairies dwell
claude says he is going to sail out there when he grows up
it is dreadfully inconvenient to be a girl at times
when it storms it is grand to see the great waves come crashing up against the big half moon as if they meant to swallow it right down
you can't see the little half moon at all then it is hidden by the mist and spume
we had our pirate cave away up among the rocks
where we kept an old pistol with the lock broken
where we sailed our toy boats and watched for sea kelpies
dick says there is no such thing as a kelpy
it is no argument against a thing that youve never seen it
the last summer before dick and mimi came we were crazy about kites
a winter boy on the mainland showed claude how to make them
when we went back to the big half moon we made kites galore
claude would go around to the other side of the big half moon and we would play shipwrecked mariners signalling to each other with kites
it used to scare the gulls nearly to death when we sent up our kites
the big half moon is such a place for gulls there are hundreds of them here
when we got tired of that claude sent me to the house for the big one
but when i was coming back over the rocks i tripped and fell
you would never have believed that one small elbow could make such a big hole
claude said it was just like a girl to fall and stick her elbow through a kite
but i don't see why it should be any more like a girl than a boy
we had to hurry to fix the kite if we wanted to send it up before the wind fell
so we rushed into the lighthouse to get some paper
so we just took the first thing that came handy an old letter that was lying on the bookcase in the sittingroom
it was the best thing we could have done but father was away to the mainland to buy things
we never thought it could make any difference about an old yellow letter
it was one father had taken from a drawer in the bookcase which he had cleaned out the night before
our kite sailing along at a fearful rate of speed over to the mainland
pointed out that it really didn't matter because i had spoiled it by jabbing my elbow through it
we never expected to see or hear of it again
a month later a letter came to the big half moon for father
such a queerlooking face as he had when he came back
do you two young pirates and freebooters want to know what has become of your kite
then he sat down beside us on the rocks at the mermaid's pool and told us the whole story
it seems father had had relations after all a brother and a sister in particular
but when he was a young man he quarrelled with his brother
who didn't treat him very well but he's been dead for years
so i won't say a word against him and had gone away from home
since he says so but i don't see how father could do anything wrong
he had a sister esther whom he loved very much but he felt bitter against her too
because he thought she took his brother's part too much
but his brother was dead and his sister had gone away
the letter father had just received was from his sister
our aunt esther and the mother of dick and mimi
she was living at a place hundreds of miles inland
although she did not say a word about it in the letter
one day when dick and mimi were out in the woods looking for botany specimens they saw something funny in the top of a tree
it was a big red kite with a patch on each side and names written on it
dick has since told us that she turned as pale as the dead when she saw our names on it
philippa was her mother's name and claude was her father's
when she read the letter that was pasted over the hole in the kite she knew who we must be
for it was the very letter she had written to her brother so long ago
this was the letter jake wiggins brought to the big half moon
next day father got jake to take his place for a few days
he left claude and me over on the mainland while he went to see aunt esther
when he came back he brought aunt esther and dick and mimi with him
they love the big half moon as well as claude and i do
but the best of it all is that we have relations now
the bride roses miss corona awoke that june morning with a sigh
the cause of which she was at first too sleepy to understand
then it all came over her with a little sickening rush she had fallen asleep with tearwet lashes the night before on account of it
could not go to the wedding and was not even invited
so chronic and bitter and terrible that it always presented itself to miss corona's mental vision as spelled with a capital
it had shut her up into a lonely life for long years
were the only relations miss corona had in the world
the old family feud divided them by a gulf which now seemed impassable
lifted one corner of the white windowblind and peeped out
below her a river of early sunshine was flowing through the garden
the faraway slopes were translucent green in their splendour of young day
was perched on the big chestnut bough that ran squarely across the window
singing as if his heart would burst with melody and the joy of his tiny life
no bride could have wished anything fairer for her day of days
miss corona dropped back on her pillows with another gentle sigh
im so glad that the dear child has a fine day to be married
although the two had never spoken to each other in their lives
miss corona was a brisk and early riser as a rule
with a genuine horror of lazy people who lay late abed or took overlong to get their eyes well opened
overloud tinkling of dishes in the room below betokened that charlotta was already up and about
was fatally sure to do something unfortunate if she were not under some careful
but miss corona was not thinking about charlotta this morning
purposeless life that she was in no haste to go forth to meet another day of it
miss corona felt just the least little bit tired of living
although she feared it was very wicked of her to feel so
looking through a mist of tears at the portrait of her stern old father hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed
living alone with her father at the old gordon homestead on the hill
with the big black spruce grove behind it on the north and farreaching slopes of green fields before it on the south
down in the little northern valley below the spruce grove lived her uncle
the mothers of both were dead neither had any other brother or sister
there had never been any sentiment or lovemaking between them to mar a perfect comradeship
whatever plans the fathers might have cherished for the union of their estates and children
the strife between the two brothers was determined and irreconcilable
corona's father forbade her to speak to her uncle and cousin or to hold any communication with them
she had always obeyed her father it had never entered into her mind to do anything else
each making a little wider and more hopeless the gulf of coldness and anger and distrust
in five months alexis gordon followed him to the grave
the two brothers who had hated each other so unyieldingly in life slept very peaceably side by side in the old gordon plot of the country graveyard
but their rancour still served to embitter the lives of their descendants
hoped that she and meredith might now be friends again
in her new and intolerable loneliness corona's heart yearned after her own people
let slip her last fluttering hope that the old breach would ever be healed
it seemed a terrible thing to her that one of her race and kin was to be married and she could not be present at the ceremony
with her face muffled in her gingham apron and her long braids of red hair hanging with limp straightness down her back
it jest slipped out so fashion fore i cd grab holt on it
at any other time she would have been filled with dismay over the untoward fate of her green and yellow bowl
which had belonged to her greatgrandmother and had stood on the hall table to hold flowers as long as she could remember
but just now her heart was so sore over the quarrel that there was no room for other regrets
i suppose it is a judgment on me for staying abed so late
she saw charlotta sally forth into the garden with a determined
without feeling interest enough to go and make sure that she did not root out all the late asters in her tardy and wilfully postponed warfare on weeds
whose heart and thoughts were still down in the festive house in the valley
roused herself enough to go out and see what charlotta was doing
at every turn you might stumble on some clump or tangle of sweetness
nothing in the garden was planted quite where it should be
she had not been there since last summer the little path was getting almost impassable
by the aromatic breath of the mint she had trodden on
it was so large and woody that it seemed more like a tree than a bush
there has not been a rose on that tree for twenty years
it bore large white roses which three generations of gordon brides had worn on their wedding day
it had come to be a family tradition among the gordons that no luck would attend the bride who did not carry a white rose from mary gordon's rosetree
nor could all the pruning and care given it coax a single blossom from it
tinctured with the superstition apt to wait on a lonely womanhood
believed in her heart that the rosebush had a secret sympathy with the fortunes of the gordon women
it had flung all its longhoarded sweetness into blossom again
but miss corona was sure there was another meaning in it too she believed it foretokened some change in her own life
some rejuvenescence of love and beauty like to that of the ancient rosetree
her cheeks were pink from excitement as she snipped them off
it was as if all the grace and perfume and beauty and glory of those twenty lost summers were found here at once in them
having atoned to her conscience for the destruction of the green and yellow bowl by faithfully weeding the garden
she did hate to call the child that foolish name with its foreign sound
just as if plain charlotte were not good enough for her
but the case was urgent she could not stand upon her dignity just now
instantly charlotta flew to the garden gate and raced up to the door
the other gordon house was in a hum of excitement
upstairs juliet had gone to her invalid mother's room to show herself in her wedding dress to the pale little lady lying on the sofa
stately young girl with the dark grey gordon eyes and the pure creaminess of colouring
im not going to put on my veil until the last moment
romney ordered pure white roses because i said a gordon bride must carry nothing else
the funniest little redheaded girl with the most enormous freckles has just brought this for you
i haven't an idea where she came from she looked like a messenger from pixyland
the rosetree has bloomed for the first time in twenty years
it must surely be in honour of your wedding day
tell him to let you wear the roses i send for old times sake
but father said it would be better not to she was so hard and bitter against us that she would probably regard it as an insult
it certainly is a great pity she was not invited
an invitation sent two hours before the ceremony would be an insult indeed
with her white silken skirts caught up above grasses and dust
ran lightfootedly through the green lowland fields and up the hill
treading for the first time the faint old fieldpath between the two homes
so long disused that it was now barely visible in its fringing grasses and stardust of buttercups
where it ran into the spruce grove was a tiny gate which miss corona had always kept in good repair
hanging over a few of the bride roses with falling tears
came in like a blessing and knelt by her chair
i have come to thank you for your roses and ask you to forgive us all for the old quarrel
you must or i shall think you have not really forgiven us
dear child but im not dressed i ill help you dress
the guests and the minister must wait if necessary yes
charlotta and the bride got her into her grey silk and did her hair
in a very short time she and juliet were hurrying down the old fieldpath
what a terrible girl it is for having its own way
who ever heard of a gordon bride doing such an unconventional thing
laura has made your roses up into what she calls a dream of a bouquet
i knew that something beautiful was going to happen when the old rosetree bloomed
the josephs christmas the month before christmas was always the most exciting and mysterious time in the joseph household
very few of the pennies hence the reason for so much contriving and consulting
it is no wonder that they had to cudgel their small brains for ways and means thereof
father and mother were always discreetly blind and silent through december
no questions were asked no matter what queer things were done
many secret trips to the little store at the railway station two miles away were ignored
no little joseph was called to account because he or she looked terribly guilty when somebody suddenly came into the room
sister mollie was the grand repository of these all the little josephs came to her for advice and assistance
how can seven sticks of candy be divided among eight people so that each shall have one
it was mollie who advised regarding the purchase of ribbon and crepe paper
it was mollie who put the finishing touches to most of the little gifts
all through december mollie was weighed down under an avalanche of responsibility
dead secrecy was the keystone of all plans and confidences
during this particular december the planning and contriving had been more difficult and the results less satisfactory than usual
but they made the brave best of their small resources
on christmas eve every little joseph went to bed with a clear conscience
for was there not on the corner table in the kitchen a small mountain of tiny sometimes very tiny gifts labelled with the names of recipients and givers
worth their weight in gold if love and good wishes count for anything
it was beginning to snow when the small small josephs went to bed
when the big small josephs climbed the stairs it was snowing thickly
mister andmistress joseph sat before the fire and listened to the wind howling about the house
it will be too bad if they can't have it when it's about all the christmas theyll have this year
this is the first christmas since we came west that we couldn't afford some little extras for them
even ift was only a box of nuts and candy
joseph sighed over jimmy's worn jacket which she was mending
look at all the little knickknacks theyve made for each other
i did feel that id ask nothing better than to go in and buy all the lovely things i wanted
weve all got each other and good health and spirits
a christmas wouldn't be much without those if we had all the presents in the world
i don't want to grumble but i tell you i did want to get maggie a real live doll
that small heart of hers is set on a real one
there was one at fisher's store today a big beauty with real hair
just fancy maggie's face if she saw such a christmas box as that tomorrow morning
talking of candy reminds me that i made a big plateful of taffy for the children today
ill get it out and put it on the table along with the children's presents
said mister joseph as he strode to the door and flung it open
a wealthy merchant in a small town fifteen miles away
we are on our way to spend christmas with my brother's family at lindsay
if you don't mind a shakedown by the kitchen fire for the night
when the two men came stamping into the house againmistress ralston andmistress joseph were sitting at the fire
the former with a steaming hot cup of tea in her hand
mister ralston put the big basket he was carrying down on a bench in the corner
so we are taking them a lot of santa claus stuff
the eyes of the lindsay youngsters will dance tomorrow that is
looked wistfully at the heap of gifts on the corner table
beside that bulgy basket with its cover suggestively tied down
our santa claus is somewhat out of pocket this year
those are the little things the small folks here have made for each other
im always kind of relieved when christmas is over and there are no more mysterious doings
were in such cramped quarters here that you can't move without stepping on somebody's secret
a shakedown was spread in the kitchen for the unexpected guests
ralston went over to the christmas table and looked at the little gifts half tenderly and half pityingly
as she touched the calendar jimmie had made for mollie out of cardboard and autumn leaves and grasses
ive a notion that id like to see some of the things in our basket right here on this table
for that matter we can send them ours when we go back home
i like the idea of giving the small folk of this household a rousing good christmas for once
i dare say pretty well pinched this year like most of the farmers hereabout after the crop failure
mister ralston got out a small pencil and a note book
by dint of comparing the names attached to the gifts on the table they managed to divide theirs up pretty evenly among the little josephs
im going to spread that tablecloth carelessly over the table
in the hurry of getting off i hope that mister andmistress joseph will not notice the difference till were gone
the dawn broke fine and clear over a vast white world
but i guess wed get to lindsay in time for dinner
when you andmistress joseph come to town we shall hope to have a chance to return it
whenmistress joseph went back to the kitchen her eyes fell on the heapedup table in the corner
then this funny little mother began to cry but they were happy tears
there really seemed to be everything on that table that the hearts of children could desire three pairs of skates
a roll of stuff that looked like a new dress
all these were to be seen at the first glance and in one corner of the table was a big box filled with candies and nuts and raisins
in the other a doll with curling golden hair and brown eyes
dressed in real clothes and with all her wardrobe in a trunk beside her
pinned to her dress was a leaf from mister ralston's notebook with maggie's name written on it
they pretty nearly did when they all came scrambling down the stairs a little later
such a christmas had never been known in the joseph household before
mollie looked at the workbasket that her housewifely little heart had always longed for
that christmas was one to date from in that family
that even in the heyday of their delight and surprise over their wonderful presents
the little josephs did not forget to appreciate the gifts they had prepared for each other
jimmy was sure the new red mittens which maggie had knitted for him with her own chubby wee fingers
it was just as good as the candy in the box and had more chew to it besides
the magical bond of the sea a late september wind from the northwest was sweeping over the waters of racicot harbour
past the grim lighthouse rock on the one hand and the sandbars on the other
until it whistled among the masts of the boats at anchor and among the stovepipe chimneys of the fishing village
it was a wind that sang and piped and keened of many things but what it sang to each listener was only what was in that listener's heart
standing at the door of her father's bleached cottage on the grey sands
the wind had sung often to her of the outer world she longed for
but there had never been the note of fulfilment in it before
you have but to put out your hand and all youve wished for will be in your grasp
nora leaned out from the door to meet the wind
she loved that northwest gale it was a staunch old friend of hers
with a skin as white as the foam flakes crisping over the sands
haunting blue that deepens on the water after a fair sunset
her lips blossomed out with a ripe redness against the uncoloured purity of her face
she was far and away the most beautiful of the harbour girls
even her friends felt themselves called upon to make excuses for her unlikeness to themselves
nora had dosed the door behind her to shut in the voices
she wanted to be alone with the wind while she made her decision
made firm by a straggling growth of some pale seaivy
uncouth houses of the village no smaller or more uncouth than the one which was her home with children playing noisily on the paths between them
the mackerel boats curtsied and nodded outside beyond them the sharp tip of sandy point was curdled white with seagulls
down at the curve of the cove a group of men were laughing and talking loudly in front of french joe's fishhouse
had built a summer cottage on that point two years ago
given it the name of the old ancestral estate in scotland
to the racicot fishing folk the house and grounds were as a dream of enchantment made real
she had been the camerons guest many times that summer
finding in the luxury and beauty of their surroundings something that entered with a strange aptness into her own nature
it was as if it were hers by right of fitness
but it pleased her to pretend for a little time that it was not
to dally tenderly withthe old loves and emotions that tugged at her heart and clamoured to be remembered
uneven floor and its blackened walls hung with fish nets and oilskins
john cameron and his wife were given the seats of honour in the middle of the room
yet her face had a good deal of plain common sense in it
not even the most critical of the racicot folks could say that she put on airs
he had laid aside his pipe out of deference tomistress cameron
he wished his wife would go to work it seemed uncanny to see her idle
she had sat idle only once that he remembered the day they had brought ned shelley in
the coat she had been patching for her husband when the camerons came still lay in her lap
handsome face a face that had not visibly stirred even when she had heard the camerons proposition
they wanted nora these rich people who had so much in life wanted the blossom of girlhood that had never bloomed for them
she is beautiful and clever she has a right to more than racicot can give her
you will see her every summer when we come to dalveigh
but i dunno as we ought to let our feelings stand in nora's light
she's been hankering for moren we can ever give her
i broke away finally went to a city and got work
she's younger than i was if the hankering for the sea and the life of the shore hasn't got into her too deep
but you don't know how the sea calls to one of its own
he thought that this dry old salt was a bit of a poet in his own way
very likely nora got her ability and originality from him
there did not seem to be a great deal in the phlegmatic
her face stung to radiant beauty by the northwest wind
she ran to her and flung her arms about her
her mother loosened the clinging arms and pushed her gently towards the camerons
before night everyone on the harbour shore knew that the camerons were going to adopt nora shelley and take her away with them
nora asked her brother to tell the news to rob fletcher himself
welloff the pick of the harbour men in every way
though she meant to be nice to him later on
but he did not choose to make a book of his heart for merran's bold black eyes to read
she was meant for better things than can be found at racicot
nora and rob did not meet until the next evening
he was at the shore to tie up her boat and help her out
they walked up the sands together in the heart of the autumn sunset
with the northwest wind whistling in their ears and the great star of the lighthouse gleaming wanly out against the golden sky
rob fletcher was nothing to her he never had been anything but the good friend to whom she told her strange thoughts and longings
i suppose you have heard that i am going away
do you think youll be able to cut twenty years of a life out of your heart without any pain
it is not as if i were going away for good
all the better for that perhaps but youll not be the same
the new life will change you not all at once
it doesn't seem as if i could help myself if i wanted to
always has been calling me ever since i was a tiny girl and found out there was a big world far away from racicot
it always seemed to me that i would find a way to it some day
that was why i kept going to school long after the other girls stopped
mother thought id better stop home she said too much book learning would make me discontented and too different from the people i had to live along
but father let me go he understood he said i was like him when he was young
it seems to me as if i had been walking along a narrow pathway all my life
now it seems as if a gate were opened before me and i can pass through into a wider world
it isn't the luxury and the pleasure or the fine house and dresses that tempt me
though the people here think so even mother thinks so
it's just that something seems to be in my grasp that ive always longed for
im not so selfish as not to be able to hope that youll find all you long for
but it will change you all the more if it is so
the sudden passion bursting out in his tone frightened her
i never had much hope of getting you to listen to me
a girl that is fit to mate with the camerons is far above rob fletcher
but it's so and now ive got to lose you
she watched his stalwart figure out of sight around the point
raged to find tears in her eyes and a bitter yearning in her heart
for a moment she repented she would stay she could not go
then over the harbour flashed out the lights of dalveigh
when tales were told of the sea and the fishing
the harbour laid itself out to be sociable in winter
people had to work eighteen hours out of the twentyfour then
in the winter there was spare time to laugh and quarrel
woo and wed and were a man so minded dream
in a racicot winter much was made of small things
the arrival of nora shelley's weekly letter to her father and mother was an event in the village
the postmistress in the cove store spread the news that it had come
read the letter aloud by virtue of having gone to school long enough to be able to pronounce the words and tell where the places named were situated
the camerons had spent the autumn in new york and had then gone south for the winter
but after the first few letters she made no further mention of that
she sent affectionate messages to all her old friends and asked after all her old interests
but the letters came to be more and more like those of a stranger and one apart from the racicot life
it had to be so it's well for her that it is so but it hurts
rob fletcher always came and listened to the letters in silence while the others buzzed and commented
he had grown unsociable and preferred to stay home and read books rather than go avisiting as did others
there was something wrong with a man who read books when there was a plenty of other amusements
jacob radnor had read books all one winter and had drowned himself in the spring jumped overboard from his dory at the herring nets
it was the first of august before a host of servants came to put dalveigh in habitable order
at sunset on the day of her arrival nora shelley looked out cross the harbour to the fishing village
she had not meant to go over until the morning
her mother was over there the old life called to her the northwest wind swept up the channel and whistled alluringly to her at the window of her luxurious room
it brought to her the tang of the salt wastes and filled her heart with a great
in the year that had passed she had blossomed out to a gracious fulfilment of womanhood
even the camerons had wondered at her swift adaptation to her new surroundings
she seemed to have put racicot behind her as one puts by an old garment
her adopted parents were proud of her beauty and her nameless
in those few short months she had lived more keenly and fully than in all her life before
but with tingling fingers she threw off her costly gown and put on her dark travelling suit again
she left her hair as it was and knotted a crimson scarf about her head
get davy to launch the little sailboat for her and then for a fleet skim over the harbour before that glorious wind
she was afraidmistress cameron would try to prevent her going
all at once she knew that she could not bear that
something in the girl's last sentence or the tone in which it was uttered brought a look of pain tomistress cameron's face
the wind is too high and it is too late for you to go over by yourself
nora would have protested but she knew it would be in vain
she submitted somewhat sullenly and walked down to the shore in silence
was one of the younger millionaires whom john cameron drew around him in the development of his huge financial schemes
this was why the camerons had asked him to join their august house party at dalveigh
it had occurred to nora that this was the case
but as yet she had never troubled to think the situation over seriously
but just at the moment he was in the way
she did not want to take him over to racicot just why she could not have explained
there was in her no snobbish shame of her humble home
but he did not belong there he was an alien
she wished to go back to it for the first time alone
at the boathouse davy launched the small sailboat and nora took the tiller
as the sail filled before the wind and the boat sprang across the upcurling waves
she no longer resented clark bryant's presence she forgot it
he was no more to her than the mast by which he stood
the spell of the sea and the wind surged into her heart and filled it with wild happiness and measureless content
where the lights gleamed on the darkening shore under the highsprung arch of pale golden sky
understanding all at once that he was nothing to her
that he had no part or lot in her heart
the shawl had slipped down to her shoulders and her head rose out of it like some magnificent flower out of a crimson calyx
the masses of her black hair lifted from her face in the rush of the wind and swayed back again like rich shadows
her lips were stung scarlet with the sea's sharp caresses
looked past him unseeing to the harbour lights of racicot
when they swung in by the wharf nora sprang from the boat before bryant had time to moor it
then she caught her shawl around her head and almost ran up the wharf and along the shore
in the shelley kitchen the family was gathered around the table
when the door was flung open and nora stood on the threshold
for a moment they gazed at her as at an apparition
they had not known the precise day of her coming and were not aware of the camerons arrival at dalveigh
she ran across the room and buried her face in her mother's breast
the racicot people crowded in to see nora until the house was full
the men smoked and most of the women knitted while they talked
they were pleased to find that nora did not put on any airs
old jonas myers bluntly told her that he didn't see as her year among rich folks had done her much good
she was glad that they did not find her changed
but as the evening wore away she grew very quiet
when they had all gone nora went out to the door alone
for it was too late an hour for racicot folk to be abroad in the mackerel season
the moon was rising and the harbour was a tossing expanse of silver waves
the mellow light fell on a tall figure lurking at the angle of the road that led past the shelley cottage
but she flung herself on his breast and clung to him
every time there was a step i said to myself
i dared not even ask after you for fear of what they might tell me
ive been hanging about thinking to get a glimpse of you unbeknown
i thought maybe you wouldn't want to see me tonight
it was you i thought of before all even before mother
she drew back and looked at him with her soul in her eyes
what a splendid fellow you are how handsome you are
all the reserve of womanhood fell away from her in the inrush of emotions
ive been in a dream this past year a lovely dream a fair dream
he had her close against his heart now the breath of her lips mingled with his
but i never knew it until i crossed the harbour tonight
then i knew it came to me all at once
i knew i could never go away again that i must stay here forever where i could hear that call of wind and waves
the new life was good good but it could not go deep enough
when you did not come i knew what was in my heart for you as well
that night nora lay beside her sisters in the tiny room that looked out on the harbour
but nora kept awake to listen to the laughter of the wind outside
con over what she and rob had said to each other
there was no blot on her happiness save a sorry wonder what the camerons would say when they knew
they don't know that i can't help it even if i would
when nora told them that she was going back to racicot
treating it as the passing whim of a homesick girl
the sea has called her and shell listen to naught else
it would have been better for her if she could have cut loose from it all and lived your life
but youve made a fair trial and it's of no use
i know what's in her heart it was in mine once and ill say no word of rebuke to her
she's free to go or stay as she chooses just as free as she was last year
but there's something stronger in me that holds me here
you have been a little homesick and you are glad to be back
but after we have gone and you must settle into the old racicot life again
you will find that your life with us will have unfitted you for this
there will be no real place for you here nothing for you to do
i thought it might once but i know better now
there did not seem to be anything more to say after that
but there were no tears in her eyes that night when she walked on the shore with rob fletcher
the stars came out in the great ebony dome of the sky over the harbour
laughter and song of the fishing folk were behind them
over the harbour gleamed the score of lights at dalveigh
it seems to me now like a beautiful garment put on for a holiday and worn easily and pleasantly for a time
it is singing of the good days to be for you and me
the martyrdom of estella estella was waiting under the poplars at the gate for spencer morgan
he always came to see her on saturday and wednesday evenings
the willow trees along the walk and the tall birches in the background stood out darkly distinct against the lemontinted sky
listening for the sound of wheels and dreamily watching the light shining out from the window of vivienne lemar's room
the blind was up and she could see miss lemar writing at her table
estella reflected without the least envy that miss lemar was very beautiful
she had never seen anyone who was really beautiful before beautiful with the loveliness of the heroines in the novels she sometimes read or the pictures she had seen
a pervading air of the content and happiness her life had always known
she was an orphan and lived with her uncle and aunt
in the summer they sometimes took a boarder for a month or two
she was an actress from the city and had around her all the glamour of a strange
she wondered what spencer would think of this beautiful woman
but he got out of his buggy and walked up the lane beside her with his arm about her
miss lemar's light had removed to the parlour where she was singing
the parlour was considered her private domain on wednesday and saturday night
he was not in the least interested in the boweses new boarder
wondering if any other girl in the world could be quite so happy as she was
when spencer came back she took him into the parlour
miss lemar stopped singing and turned around on the organ stool as they entered
the little room was flooded with a mellow light from the pinkglobed lamp on the table
he bowed awkwardly and sat stiffly down by the window with his eyes riveted on miss lemar's face
catching a glimpse of herself in the oldfashioned mirror above the mantel
her figure had never seemed to her so stout and stiff
she wished miss lemar would go out of the room
vivienne lemar watched the two faces before her a hard gleam
flashed into her eyes and a smile crept about her lips
she looked straight in spencer morgan's honest blue eyes and read there the young man's dazzled admiration
there was contempt in the look she turned on estella
the gleaming curves of her neck and shoulders rose out of their filmy sheathings of lace
sitting where he could see her face with its roseleaf bloom and the ringlets of golden hair clustering about it
she suddenly began to hate the blackeyed witch at the organ and to fear her as well
she wished she had not brought him in at all
looking down at her with a strange fire in his eyes
she went in and upstairs to her room with ostentatious footsteps
she was too angry to cry or to realize what had happened
still kept hoping all sorts of impossible things as she sat by her window
it was ten o'clock when spencer went away and vivienne lemar passed up the hall to her room
estella clenched her hands in an access of helpless rage
but under her fury was a horrible ache of pain
it could not be only three hours since she had been so happy
perhaps spencer had come out to look for her after she had gone upstairs and
had gone back to miss lemar to show her he was angry
spencer did not like people who were spiteful and jealous
she would show him she was sorry when he came back
trying to convince herself that she had exaggerated everything absurdly
towards morning she fell asleep and awoke hardly remembering what had happened
it had been hardest to lie there and do nothing
now the day was before her and something pleasant might happen
she would be doubly nice to him to make up
bowes looked sharply at her niece's dull eyes and pale cheeks at the breakfast table
did you go upstairs last night and leave spencer morgan with miss lemar
she wished she were a hundred miles away from everyone she ever knew
i think it is a pretty queer piece of business
he stayed with her till ten o'clock and when he left she did everything but kiss him and she asked him to come back too
she felt as if her aunt were striking her blow after blow on a sensitive
i don't believe that lemar girl is a bit better than she ought to be
ill send her packing right off and not give her a chance to make mischief atween folks
it's all nonsense about spencer it was my fault and anyhow
estella went about her work like one in a dream
a great hatred had sprung up in her heart against vivienne lemar
for she could not quell the hope that spencer would surely come again
but he did not and when she went up to bed
it did not seem as if she could live through the night
she was afraid if she stopped work for a moment she would go mad
at night she walked to prayer meeting in the schoolhouse a mile away
it was dreadful to have to sit still and think
she had to walk home with a crowd of girls and nerve herself to answer their merry sallies that no one might suspect
she was tortured by the fear that everyone knew her shame and humiliation and was pitying her
but underneath all she was constantly trying to assign a satisfactory reason for spencer's nonappearance
of course he was a little cross at her yet
she could have gone down in the very dust at his feet and implored his forgiveness
when she reached home she went into the garden and sat down
she thought over all that had passed between her and spencer and all his loving assurances
presently she said bluntly do you know that spencer morgan was here last night
i don't know that he forgot it was prayer meeting night
't isn't likely his memory has failed so all at once
he took good care to go before you got home too
i don't care ill show them both i don't care
hell be ashamed of himself when he comes to them again
he knows very well in his heart that youre worth ten girls like her
don't keep looking at me as if i were a martyr
she watches us and it would please her to think i cared
i don't and i mean she shall see i don't
i guess im well rid of a fellow as fickle as he is
tearing off her turquoise engagement ring as she climbed the steps
she would go down and confront vivienne lemar she would rush off and find spencer and throw his ring at him
no matter where he was she would go away where no one would ever see her again
was it possible people could suffer like this and yet go on living
as if she hoped that by this means she would come to believe it
when twilight came she went out to the front steps and leaned her aching head against the honeysuckle trellis
the sun had just set and the whole world swam in dusky golden light
a buggy came driving up the lane and wheeled about at the steps
in spite of the maddening throb of hope that seemed suddenly to transfigure the world for her
had she but been sure that he had come to see her
estella caught the glance and her jealous perception instantly divined its true significance
that he was sorry that he still loved her she could forgive him everything
surely he would not go surely he knew she did not mean it he would turn back before he got to the gate
she saw him disappear around the turn of the road
she could not see if he took the shore lane further on
she was furious at herself for acting as she had done
she was in her room when she heard the buggy drive up again
she knew it was spencer and that he had brought vivienne lemar home
the girl stepped out on the landing and confronted her rival as she came up the stairs
the latter paused at sight of the white face and anguished eyes
there was a little mocking smile on her lovely face
i would advise you to look after him more sharply
she passed on to her room with a malicious smile
she crawled back to her room and threw herself face downward on the bed
but she had to live through the horrible month that followed a month so full of agony that she seemed to draw every breath in pain
spencer never sought her again he went everywhere with miss lemar
her pride smarted but she carried a brave front outwardly
she believed that the actress was merely deluding spencer for her own amusement and would never dream of marrying him
but one day the idea occurred to her that she might
estella had always told herself that even if spencer wanted to come back to her she would never take him back
she knew how strong the hope had really been and despised herself more than ever
she had lit the lamp and was listlessly arranging the little room
estella dropped the book she held and gazed at her as one in a dream
the actress's face was flushed and her hair was wildly disordered
estella turned white with the passion of the wild idea that had come to her
spencer morgan should see this woman in her true colours
swiftly she left the room and locked the door behind her on the maudlin
then she flung a shawl over her head and ran from the house
estella caught him by the arm and pulled him outside
surely it was the strangest walk ever a girl had
she pushed the key into his hand at the porch
spencer snatched the key and fitted it into the door
the actress reeled to her feet and came to meet him
he grew sick at heart and brain she had her arms about him
he flung her from him with an effort and rushed out through the hall and down the road like a madman
she was glad with a joy more pitiful than grief
the interest and curiosity of the village centred around spencer morgan
gossip said that the actress had jilted him and that he was breaking his heart about it
she had never met spencer since the night she went after him
she sometimes wondered what he must think of her for what she had done
it was rather a relief to hear that he was going away
she would not be tortured by the fear of meeting him then
she was sure he would never come back to her
one evening in early harvest estella was lingering by the lane gate at twilight
she had worked slavishly all day and was very tired
where her trouble always seemed to weigh on her more heavily
sweet night seemed to soothe her as it always did
she leaned her head against the poplar by the gate
how long spencer morgan had been standing by her she did not know
in the dim light she could see how haggard and holloweyed he had grown
the girl's first proud impulse was to turn coldly away and leave him
but some strange tumult in her heart kept her still
i know you can never forgive me no girl could
i don't think i could have been in my right senses
there were a hundred things she wanted to say but she could not say them
the young man turned away despairingly from her rigid attitude
so be it he had brought his fate on himself
he had gone but a few steps when estella suddenly found her voice with a gasp
when it passed i hated life because id lost you
estella flung her arms around his neck and put her face up to his
she felt as if her heart must break with its great happiness
the old chest at wyther grange when i was a child i always thought a visit to wyther grange was a great treat
yet i could never overcome a certain awe of them both
dignified old lady with keen black eyes that seemed veritably to bore through one
she always wore stifflyrustling gowns of rich silk made in the fashion of her youth
but the impression on my mind was always the same
as she went trailing about the house with a big bunch of keys at her belt keys that opened a score of wonderful old chests and boxes and drawers
it was one of my dearest delights to attend grandmother in her peregrinations and watch the unfolding and examining of all those old treasures and heirlooms of bygone laurances
possibly because she dressed in a modern way and so looked to my small eyes more human and natural
as winnifred laurance she had been the beauty of the family and was a handsome woman still
was my childish ideal of all that was highbred and graceful
big enough to have comfortably housed a family in itself
was filled with castoff furniture and old trunks and boxes of discarded finery
dressing up in the oldfashioned gowns and hats and practising oldtime dance steps before the high
there was one old chest which i could not explore and
from some words which i had heard grandmother let fall i was sure it had a history it was the one thing she never explored in her periodical overhaulings
when i grew tired of playing i liked to creep up on it and sit there
i was sitting there one day when aunt winnifred and grandmother laurance came up the narrow dark staircase
the latter jingling her keys and peering into the dusty corners as she came along the room
the moths may have got into it through that crack in the lid
i am sure that key of robert's would fit the lock
she confided it to my care when she went away
i promised that it should never be opened until she came for it
she might have married well but she preferred to waste her life pining over the memory of a man who was not worthy to untie the shoelace of a laurance
people said that she had had her own romance in her youth and that her mother had sternly repressed it
i had heard that her marriage with mister delisle was loveless on her part and proved very unhappy
i will write to eliza and ask her if i may open the chest to see if the moths have got into it
she will cling to her old sentimental ideas as long as the breath is in her body
it took on a new significance in my eyes and seemed to me like the tomb of something possibly some dead and buried romance of the past
later on a letter came to grandmother she passed it over the table tomistress delisle
i would know her writing anywhere none of your modern sprawly
winnifred i haven't my glasses and i dare say eliza's rhapsodies would tire me very much
you need not read them aloud i can imagine them all
aunt winnifred opened and read the letter and laid it down with a brief sigh
if it were not for one thing that is in it
i would ask you to open the chest and burn all its contents
but i can not bear that anyone but myself should see or touch that one thing
it is no matter if the moths do get in
i have always had an almost childish curiosity about that old chest
i have always thought that she locked it away there
it was not until ten years afterwards that i heard anything more of the old chest
the winter after grandmother's death she sent me an invitation to make her a long visit
when i revisited the garret and saw the old blue chest in the same dusty corner
my childish curiosity revived and i begged aunt winnifred to tell me its history
i have intended to open the chest ever since mother's death but i kept putting it off
but even then mother would not have the chest opened
there is no reason why it should not be examined now
we will go and open it at once and afterwards i will tell you the story
aunt knelt down before the old chest and selected a key from the bunch at her belt
i do not believe you would be any more disappointed than i
with a fine tracing of sifted dust in its crinkles
i lifted the paper up and saw that the chest was divided into two compartments
lifting up the cover she laid it in my lap
look through it and let us see what old treasures have lain hidden there these forty years
the first thing i took out was a small square case covered with dark purple velvet
the tiny clasp was almost rusted away and yielded easily
lovely indeed was the face looking out at me from its border of tarnished gilt
caught high on the crown and falling on her neck in the long curls of a bygone fashion
the curves of her bare neck and shoulders were exquisite
the other picture is that of the man to whom she was betrothed
it was that of a young man of about twentyfive he was undeniably handsome
but there was something i did not like in his face and i said so
aunt winnifred made no reply she was taking out the remaining contents of the box
there was a white silk fan with delicately carved ivory sticks
a packet of old letters and a folded paper containing some dried and crumpled flowers
aunt laid the box aside and unpacked the chest in silence
baby waist and full puffed sleeves of a former generation
beneath it was a case containing a necklace of small but perfect pearls and a pair of tiny satin slippers
the rest of the compartment was filled with household linen
fine and costly but yellowed with age damask table linen and webs of the uncut fabric
it was a gown of rich silk that had once been white
it was simply made and trimmed with cobwebby old lace
oldtime perfume that had kept its sweetness all through the years
you see i know nothing at all except her name
tell me who she was and why she put her wedding dress away here
he was a rich man and his daughter was much sought after
her home was in a distant city and she never came to wyther grange
she and i were of the same age and did not look unlike each other
you can see by the portrait how beautiful she was
for half her charm lay in her arch expression and her vivacious ways
this did not seem much of a defect to me then
one winter eliza came to wyther grange for a long visit
we went out a great deal and she was always the belle of any festivity we attended
yet she wore her honours easily all the flattery and homage she received did not turn her head
but one or two of the best families took him up
mother was almost the only one who did not worship at his shrine
very often she dropped hints about penniless adventurers that made eliza very indignant
from the first he had paid eliza marked attention and seemed utterly bewitched by her
i shall never forget the night they were first engaged
i suppose that is why she put it away here the gown she wore on the happiest night of her life
i had never seen her look more beautiful her neck and arms were bare
she wore this string of pearls and carried a bouquet of her favourite white roses
eliza was so perfectly happy that she seemed to grow more beautiful and radiant every day
not a stitch was set in eliza's save those put there by loving fingers and blessed by loving wishes
it was i who draped the veil over her sunny curls see how yellow and creased it is now
in speaking of the invited guests eliza said something about the other eliza laurance
looking archly at willis over her shoulder as she spoke
it was some merry badinage about the cousin whose namesake she was but whom she so little resembled
but i shall never forget the look that came over willis starr's face
a few minutes later i left the room on some trifling errand
as i returned through the dim hall i was met by willis starr
he laid his hand on my arm and bent his evil face for it was evil then
she is our cousin and the daughter of our uncle george
we have never dreamed of allowing anyone to think that eliza was an heiress
she is sweet and lovely enough to be loved for her own sake
willis starr remained gloomy and taciturn all the rest of the evening
the next day we were all so busy that i almost forgot the incident of the previous evening
we girls were up in the sewing room putting the last touches to the wedding gown
eliza tried it and her veil on and was standing so
when i returned she was still standing just where i had left her in the middle of the room
agonized look as of someone who had been stricken a mortal blow
all the soft happiness and sweetness had gone out of them
dropped the letter in a bed of writhing blue flame and watched it burn to white ashes
he says he is too poor for us to dream of marrying when i have nothing
there was something terrible in the contrast between her passionate words and her calm face and lifeless voice
trailing along the dark hall in her dress and veil
i told it all to the others in some fashion
young fellow then went at once to seek willis starr
the whole country rang with the gossip and scandal of the affair
for she was ill and unconscious for many a day
her very nature seemed to have changed too all her joyousness and lightheartedness were dead
no more like the eliza we had known than the merest stranger
then after a while came other news willis starr was married to the other eliza laurance
we tried to keep it from eliza but she found it out at last
that was the day she came up here alone and packed this old chest
her youth and happiness this old chest was the tomb of it all
before she went she exacted a promise from mother that the old chest should be left at the grange unopened until she came for it herself
it was all over so long ago the heartbreak and the misery but it all seems to come back to me now
my own eyes were full of tears as aunt winnifred went down the stairs
with the old yellowed bridal veil across my lap and the portrait of eliza laurance in my hand
around me were the relics of her pitiful story the old
oftrepeated story of a faithless love and a woman's broken heart the gown she had worn
the slippers in which she had danced lightheartedly at her betrothal ball
her gloves and it somehow seemed to me as if i were living in those old years myself
the betrayal and pain were part of my own life
let us put all these things back in their grave
i dare say but it would seem like a sacrilege
put everything back just as we found it only her portrait
reverently we put gowns and letters and trinkets back into the old blue chest
aunt winnifred closed the lid and turned the key softly
she bowed her head over it for a minute and then we went together in silence down the shadowy garret stairs of wyther grange
the osbornes christmas cousin myra had come to spend christmas at the firs
all the junior osbornes were ready to stand on their heads with delight
but the fact of christmas itself awoke no great enthusiasm in the hearts of the junior osbornes
frank voiced their opinion of it the day after cousin myra had arrived
he was sitting on the table with his hands in his pockets and a cynical sneer on his face
he knew that uncle edgar was said to wear a cynical sneer
frank admired uncle edgar very much and imitated him in every possible way
but to you and me it would have looked just as it did to cousin myra a very discontented and unbecoming scowl
that was what uncle edgar called things that didn't interest him
he wondered uncomfortably what made cousin myra smile so queerly
i thought all boys and girls looked upon christmas as the very best time in the year
it's just the same old thing year in and year out
we even know pretty well what presents we are going to get
all the uncles and aunts come to dinner just the same old crowd
after dinner theyll sit round and talk the rest of the day
theyve all got so many things already it's no end of bother to think of something new
how much christmas do you suppose those little rolands down there in the hollow have
even frank forgot that he was supposed to be wearing a cynical sneer
he had heard frank saying the same words in the same tone
cousin myra had a talk with father and mother osborne that night
for the next week the osbornes were agog with excitement and interest
christmas morning there was not a single present given or received at the firs except those which cousin myra and mister andmistress osborne gave to each other
the junior osbornes had asked that the money which their parents had planned to spend in presents for them be given to them the previous week and given it was
the junior osbornes were having a christmas dinner party of their own
in the small dining room a table was spread and loaded with good things
ida and the twins cooked that dinner all by themselves
frank and darby had stoned all the raisins and helped pull the homemade candy and all together they had decorated the small dining room royally with christmas greens
all the little rolands from the hollow arrived seven in all
shining faces and not a word to say for themselves
then came a troop from french joe's four blackeyed lads
frank drove down to the village in the cutter and brought lame sammy back with him
who was miss rankin's orphan sylum girl from over the road
but she did not prevent tillie from going to the osbornes dinner party
just at first the guests were a little stiff and unsocial but they soon got acquainted
so jolly was cousin myra who had her dinner with the children in preference to the grownups and so friendly the junior osbornes
how those guests did eat and frankly enjoy the good things before them
myra had secretly been a little dubious about those four mischievouslooking lads
french joe had been drilling them for three days ever since they had been invited to de chrismus dinner at de beeg house
they had bought them with the money that mister andmistress osborne had meant for their own presents
all the frenchjoe boys got a pair of skates apiece
tillie was made supremely happy with a big wax doll
every little roland got just what his or her small heart had been longing for
having driven the rolands and the french joes and sammy and tillie to their respective homes
i thought we were just going to give the others a good time
me and teddy roland are going to be chums after this
that night frank and ida and cousin myra had a little talk after the smaller osbornes had been haled off to bed
the romance of aunt beatrice margaret always maintains that it was a direct inspiration of providence that took her across the street to see aunt beatrice that night
but the truth of the matter is that margaret was feeling very unhappy
went over to talk to aunt beatrice as the only alternative to a fit of crying
margaret's unhappiness has nothing further to do with this story
so it may be dismissed with the remark that it did not amount to much
was dissipated at once and forever by the arrival of a certain missent letter the next day
her brother and his wife had gone to the at home whichmistress cunningham was giving that night in honour of the honourable john reynolds
a big basketful of which loomed up aggressively on the table beside her
just when margaret was sliding across the icy street aunt beatrice was bent forward in her chair
aunt beatrice started guiltily and wished earnestly that she had waited until she went to bed before crying
to suspect the fact or the cause of her tears
she was too deeply absorbed in her own troubles to think that anyone else in the world could be miserable too
she curled up in the deep easychair by the fire
clasped her hands behind her curly head with a sigh of physical comfort and mental unhappiness
feeling that she must make some conversation to justify her appearance
the hole she was darning in the knee of willie hayden's stocking must be done very carefully
wondering why there had been no letter for her that morning and this was the third day too
or was he flirting with some other girl and forgetting her
either if he was as hateful and fickle as that what was aunt beatrice saying
the truth is i have no dress fit to wear
because the party was to be a very fashionable affair
she said my old grey silk wouldn't do at all
it would be very foolish of me to get an expensive dress that would be no use to me afterward
although it had made quite a sensation in quiet little murraybridge
where people still called an at home a party plain and simple
then he went out to british columbia and and we never heard much more about him
he's very rich and owns dozens of mines and railroads and things like that
they say he's one of the foremost men in the house and came very near getting a portfolio in the new cabinet
wouldn't it be awfully nice and complimentary to have one of them in love with you
she wiped away the drop of blood and went on with her work
with warm bronze tones where the lamplight fell on it under that hideous weird old shade
but aunt beatrice wore it in such an unbecoming way
margaret idly wondered if she would comb her hair straight back and prim when she was thirtyfive
she thought it very probable if that letter did not come tomorrow
from aunt beatrice's hair margaret's eyes fell to aunt beatrice's face
margaret's sudden attack fairly startled the truth out of her
id have been quite willing to wear my grey silk
she paused long enough to give a little sob which she could not repress
i suppose you don't understand why i wanted to go to this particular party so much
ill tell you why if you won't laugh at me
i wanted to see john reynolds not to talk to him oh
i dare say he wouldn't remember me but just to see him
in her interest she quite forgot her own pet grievance
it was a dreadful quarrel and it was about such a trifle
it is all over long ago and everybody has forgotten
but i just wanted to see him once more and then come quietly away
ill drag you there by main force if it comes to that
the folks at home all said it was too severe for me and so it is
gilbert always declared that dress made me look like a cross between an unwilling nun and a ballet girl
it's not more than half an hour since uncle george and aunt bella went
if the twins wake up ill give them what is it you give them soothing syrup
she flung the stockings into the basket and the basket into the closet
i will go and i won't do another bit of darning tonight
when margaret came flying up the stairs aunt beatrice was ready save for hair and dress
revealing all its beauty of jetted lace and soft yellow silk with a dextrous sweep of her arm
ive brought you my opera cape and my fascinator and my black satin slippers with the cunningest gold buckles
some sweet pale yellow roses that uncle ned gave me yesterday
mine are so scrawny im just ashamed to have people know they belong to me
aunt beatrice's hair went up as if by magic into soft puffs and waves and twists
then the lovely dress was put on and pinned and looped and pulled until it fell into its simple
when margaret had gone aunt beatrice caught up the lamp and tiptoed shamefacedly across the hall to the icycold spare room
in the long mirror she saw herself reflected from top to toe or was it herself
could it be that gracious woman with the sweet eyes and flushed cheeks
with rounded arms gleaming through their black laces and the cluster of roses nestling against the warm white flesh of the shoulder
how i wish i could go in and see the sensation youll make
in the hallmistress cunningham herself came beamingly to greet her
bella said you could not come because you had a headache
might not her historic falsehood be traced to its influence
cunningham was not particularly noted in murraybridge for her tact
but she had a sudden visitation of the saving grace at that moment
boyish young lover whose image she had carried in her heart all the long years
just as it used to when she had loved to poke her fingers through it and
the deepset grey eyes looking down into her blue ones were unchanged
i expected to meet you here and i was horribly disappointed
i thought the bitterness of that foolish old quarrel must be strong enough to sway you yet
ive been sulking in corners ever since i concluded you were not coming
but the sweet old knowledge had come back to her again
she could not help knowing that he spoke the simple truth
don't you remember you used to tell me i was too thin to be pretty
but i suppose a bit of blarney is a necessary ingredient in the composition of an m
with a glance of dissatisfaction at the open parlour door
he drew her away to the little room at the end of the hall
i want to have a long talk with you before the other people get hold of you
when beatrice got home from the party ten minutes before her brother and his wife
it was so funny to see bella staring at it
when margaret had put on her hat and jacket she went as far as the street door
although i know it is a heinous offence to interrupt the kind of musing that goes with dying embers and faded roses in the small hours
but it would weigh on my conscience all night if i didn't
but i wakened up just before you came in and went to the window
i didn't mean to spy upon anyone but that street was bright as day
i wouldn't have cared if there had been a dozen onlookers
won't you ask me to visit you when you go down to ottawa next winter
im told it's such a jolly place when the house is in session
the wife of a cabinet minister has to do lots of that
the running away of chester chester did the chores with unusual vim that night
his lips were set and there was an air of resolution as plainly visible on his small
i s pose he's in a gog to be off on some foolishness with henry wilson
but he took a more lenient view of it than didmistress elwell
the little chap is going through things with a rush this evening
guess he's laying out for a bit of fun with the wilson boy
but chester was not planning anything connected with henry wilson
who lived on the other side of the pond and was the only chum he possessed
chester stephens was an orphan without kith or kin in the world
she had scolded and worried the boy all his short life
elwell was not a person one would care to make an enemy of
expecting some request to be allowed to go with henry
when she had recovered from her surprise at this unexpected question
the other boys are ever so far ahead of me
i suppose you want to go to school to idle away your time
as you do at home lazy goodfornothing that you are
chester thought of the drudgery that had been his portion all his life
he resented being called lazy when he was willing enough to work
ill work twice as hard out of school to make up for it indeed
i haven't been to school a day for over a year
taking a bottle from the shelf above her with the air of one who closes a discussion
run down to the bridge and get me this bottle full of vinegar at jacob's store
i ain't going to have you idling around the bridge neither
chester did his errand at the bridge with a heart full of bitter disappointment and anger
i wish i could get out west on the harvest excursions
the bottle of vinegar slipped from his hand and was broken on the doorstep
she rushed out and jerked the unlucky lad to his feet
ill teach you to break and spill things youre sent for
chester crept off to his garret chamber with a very sullen face
he was too used to being sent to bed without any supper to care much for that
but his whole being was in a tumult of rebellion over the injustice that was meted out to him
to do it without a cent in your pocket or a place to run to was another
but chester had a great deal of determination in his makeup when it was fairly roused
his hard upbringing had made him older and shrewder than his years
abner stearns wants you to go up there for a fortnight while tom bixby is away
drive the milk wagon of mornings and do the chores formistress stearns
you might as well put in the time fore harvest that way as any other
he had not yet devised any feasible plan for running away
the following fortnight was a comparatively happy one for the lad
but he did not forget his purpose of shaking the dust of upton from his feet as soon as possible
formistress elwell had always insisted that all such money should be paid directly to her
chester found himself the possessor of four dollars an amount of riches that almost took away his breath
he had never in his whole life owned more than ten cents at a time
as if he feared it would otherwise dissolve into thin air
this money was rightly his he had earned every cent of it
it would surely last him until he found employment elsewhere
lige had given warning and this on the verge of harvest
did stearns say anything about coming down tomorrow to pay me for your work
the boy had a vague wish to carry away with him some kindly word or look from her
chester obeyed her command and took himself off to the garret
mistress elwell was quite likely to march up and demand the amount of chester's wages
the only decent suit of clothes he possessed was his wellworn sunday one
carefully stowing away in his pocket the precious four dollars
he had to wait until he thought his aunt was asleep
when he found himself alone in the clear moonlight of the august night
wisht i could have seen henry to say goodby to him
chester meant to walk to roxbury station ten miles away
he kept to fields and woodroads lest he might be seen and recognized
he knew the train did not pass through until six
with the serenity of a philosopher who is starting out to win his way in the world and means to make the best of things
chester curled himself up in the hollow space of a big lumber pile behind the station
so tired was he that he fell soundly asleep in a few minutes
chester was awakened by the shriek of the express at the last crossing before the station
in a panic of haste he scrambled out of his lumber and dashed into the station house
squarejawed boy who asked for a secondclass ticket to belltown
chester's heart quaked within him at the momentary thought that the ticket agent recognized him
he had an agonized vision of being collared without ceremony and haled straightway back to aunt harriet
when the ticket and his change were pushed out to him
who did not sell many tickets and so had time to take a personal interest in the purchasers thereof
chester drew an audible sigh of relief when the train left the station
he was fairly off now and felt that he could defy even curious railway officials
formistress elwell had once taken him to belltown to get an aching tooth extracted
but it was certainly his first under such exhilarating circumstances
was only what he would probably be many times before he made his fortune
it was just as well to get used to it
on the road from roxbury to belltown there was not much to be seen that morning that chester did not see
he did not mean to stop long there it was too near upton
he found that a boat left belltown for montrose at two in the afternoon
he went into a grocery store and bought some crackers and a bit of cheese
he had somewhere picked up the idea that crackers and cheese were about as economical food as you could find for adventurous youths starting out on small capital
he found his way to the only public square belltown boasted
munched his food hungrily on a bench under the trees
he would go to montrose and there find something to do
later on he would gradually work his way out west
where there was more room for an ambitious small boy to expand and grow
chester dreamed some dazzling dreams as he sat there on the bench under the belltown chestnuts
but this same lad was mapping out a very brilliant future for himself as people passed him heedlessly by
he would go back to upton for a visit and shine in his splendour before all his old neighbours
so cheered him up that he felt ready for anything
he was aroused from a dream of passing aunt harriet by in lofty scorn and a glittering carriage
chester pocketed his remaining crackers and cheese and his visions also
he had inquired the way to the wharf from the grocer
for he was anything but sure that he would not encounter some upton people as long as he was in it
chester scrutinized them all so sharply in turn that he could have sworn to each and every one of them for years afterwards had it been necessary
the one he liked best was a middleaged lady who sat just before him on the opposite side of the deck she was plump and motherly looking
if i was looking for anyone to adopt me id pick her
she smiled promptly at him a smile that seemed fairly to irradiate her round face and then began fumbling in an oldfashioned reticule she carried
from which she presently extracted a chubby little paper bag
chester did not exactly like being called a little boy
but her voice and smile were irresistible and won his heart straightway
it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted in his life
filled a void which even the crackers and cheese had left vacant
the rosy lady watched every mouthful he ate as if she enjoyed it more than he did
when he had finished the taffy she smiled one of her sociable smiles again and said
as if he were a connoisseur in all kinds of taffies
that is just what everyone says about my sugar taffy
as if his appreciation of her taffy was a bond of good fellowship between them
she was filling the heart of a desperate small boy
if there were such kind folks as this in the world
chester lost sight of the rosy lady when they left the boat
it gave him a lonesome feeling but he could not indulge in that for long at a time
it was only a bustling little town of some twenty thousand inhabitants
he had never been in any place bigger than belltown
montrose seemed endless to chester as he stood at the head of water street and gazed in bewilderment along one of its main business avenues a big
whirling place where one small boy could so easily be swallowed up that he would never be heard of again
after paying his fare to montrose and buying his cheese and crackers
so that the luxury of lodgings was out of the question
even if he had known where to look for them
there were benches in a public square right in front of him but chester was afraid that if he curled up on one of them for the night
he did not believe he could give a very satisfactory account of himself
back to this he went and soon succeeded in finding a place to stow himself
his last waking thought was that he must be up and doing bright and early the next morning
that it must surely be longer than twentyfour hours since he had crept downstairs and out of aunt harriet's porch window at upton
which was not so bewildering as the blinking electric lights
ate the last of his cheese and crackers and started out at once to look for work
he went straight into every place of business he came to
boldly asked the first person he met if they wanted a boy there
the last winter he had been allowed to go to school in upton
patient little woman who hated the liquor traffic with all her heart
she instilled into her pupils a thorough aversion to it
chester would have chosen death by starvation before he would have sought for employment in a liquor saloon
but there certainly did not seem room for him anywhere else
he had gone into a big provision store and asked the clerk behind the counter if they wanted a boy
stubby man was sitting before a desk with his feet upon it
sir i mean im ever so much stronger than i look
what was grim earnest to poor chester was a joke to him
but im afraid youll hardly grow fast enough to suit us
chester went out of the store with a queer choking in his throat
for one horrible moment he thought he was going to cry he
who had run away from home to do splendid things
a nice ending that would be to his fine dreams
he thrust his hands into his pockets and strode along the street
he parted with ten cents of his precious hoard for more crackers
but it really seemed as if there were to be no luck for chester except bad luck
although he tramped resolutely from street to street and visited every place that seemed to offer any chance
at the end of a week chester woke up among his lumber to a realization that he was at the end of his resources
he had just five cents left out of the four dollars that were to have been the key to his fortune
he sat gloomily on the wall of his sleeping apartment and munched the one solitary cracker he had left
it must carry him through the day unless he got work
the five cents must be kept for some dire emergency
in his week's wanderings he had come to know the city very well and no longer felt confused with its size and bustle
back in upton he had sometimes resented the fact that he was kept working continually and was seldom allowed an hour off
it certainly did not seem as if things were fairly divided
for one of the queer spells in his head came on
he had experienced them at intervals during the last three days
something seemed to break loose in his head and spin wildly round and round
while houses and people and trees danced and wobbled all about him
chester vaguely wondered if this could be what aunt harriet had been wont to call a judgement
he had done nothing very bad nothing that would warrant a judgement
it was surely no harm to run away from a place where you were treated so bad and where they did not seem to want you
presently he found himself in the market square of montrose
the place was thronged with people from the surrounding country settlements
chester had hoped that he might pick up a few cents
holding a horse or cow for somebody or carrying a market basket
he climbed up on some bales of pressed hay in one corner and sat there moodily there was dejection in the very dangle of his legs over the bales
but presently a sentence made him prick up his ears
but whether it's going to be got in in good shape is another matter
every spare manjack far and wide has gone west on them everlasting harvest excursions
salome whitney at the mount hope farm is in a predicament
trying to get a couple of men or boys to help him
but chester got down from the bales with a determined look
he had done a man's work at harvest time in upton the year before
he accosted the first man he met and asked if he could tell him the way to hopedale
i can give you a lift part of the way
but i must go at once if youll kindly direct me
that's albemarle street down there follow it till it takes you out to the country
then keep straight on till you come to a church painted yellow and white
he could walk twenty with hope to lure him on
albemarle street finally frayed off into a real country road
chester was glad to find himself out in the country once more
with the great golden fields basking on either side and the wooded hills beyond
he had grown to hate the town with its cold
it was good to breathe clear air again and feel the soft
springy soil of the ferny roadside under his tired little feet
chester began to wonder if he would hold out to the end of them
the white and yellow church was the most welcome sight that had ever met his eyes
over the hill he met a man and inquired the way to mount hope farm
at the gate chester had to stop again to recover from his dizziness
all set down in a trim quadrangle of beeches and orchards
there was an appearance of peace and prosperity about it
wisht what chester's third wish was will never be known
for just as he reached the kitchen door the worst dizzy spell of all came on
in the mount hope kitchen miss salome was at that moment deep in discussion with her help over the weighty question of how the damsons were to be preserved
both knew that in the end the damsons would be baked
but the argument had to be carried out for dignity's sake
miss salome knew that when clemantiny dragged her grandmother into the question
it would be useless to say that she did not want to keep her damsons for three years
that she was content to eat them up and trust to providence for the next year's supply
i don't suppose it makes much difference one way or another
grasping a broom handle with a grimness that boded ill for the dog
mussing up my clean doorstep with his dirty paws again
clemantiny swept out through the porch and jerked open the door
what miss salome saw when she hurried out was a whitefaced boy stretched on the doorstep at clemantiny's feet
looks more to me as if he had fainted from sheer starvation
returned clemantiny brusquely as she picked him up in her lean
said miss salome as soon as she had recovered from the horror into which clemantiny's starvation dictum had thrown her
wet their face and hist up their feet and loosen their collar
when chester came back to consciousness with the pungency of the ammonia reeking through his head
he found himself lying on very soft pillows in a very big white sunny kitchen
where everything was scoured to a brightness that dazzled you
standing beside her with a steaming bowl in her hand
was the nice rosy lady who had given him the taffy on the boat
now perhaps youll explain what you mean by fainting away on doorsteps and scaring people out of their senses
chester thought that this must be the mistress of mount hope farm
i didn't mean to i youre not to do any talking until youve had something to eat
clemantiny spoke as sharply as aunt harriet had ever done
but somehow or other chester did not feel afraid of her and her black eyes
she sat down by his side and fed him from the bowl of hot broth with a deft gentleness oddly in contrast with her grim expression
chester thought he had never in all his life tasted anything so good as that broth
clemantiny gave a grunt of satisfaction as she handed the empty bowl and spoon to the silent
while coming along the hopedale road he had thought out an answer to it
my folks are dead and i came to montrose to look for work
ive been there a week and couldn't get anything to do
i heard a man say that you wanted men to help in the harvest
so i came out to see if youd hire me
chester's face turned very red before he got to the end of his speech
chester could not have felt or looked more guilty if he had been telling an outandout falsehood at every breath
what on earth do you suppose a midget like you can do in the harvest field
clemantiny knew that when miss salome did make up her mind and announced it in that very quiet
she was mistress of the situation and intended to remain so
i think it would be wiser to wait until you found out a little more about him
returned clemantiny with the air of one who washes her hands of a doubtful proposition
by this time chester had grasped the wonderful fact that his troubles were ended for a while
he raised himself up on one arm and looked gratefully at miss salome
there's a look on his face that reminded me of johnny
it came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying
who was flying about the kitchen with a speed that made chester's head dizzy trying to follow her with his eyes
all i can see is freckles and bones but if youre satisfied
there's a hundred and one things to be done out of hand
after dinner chester decided that it was time to make himself useful
you can go out and cut me some wood for my afternoon's baking
any other boy that's tried always gets it about two inches too long
what do you expect that size to accomplish in a harvest field
you wouldn't have me turn the child adrift on the world again
your philanthropy will hardly lead you as far as that
when clemantiny employed big words and sarcasm at the same time
id find out what it was before i took him into my house
she understood that it would be a waste of breath to say anything more
if miss salome had made up her mind to put this freckled
she muttered as she carried her dishes into the pantry
first a skinny little urchin goes and faints on her doorstep
then she hires him and puts him in johnny's room
but somehow her heart went out warmly to this boy
she held to the opinion that he looked like johnny
she had taken him to bring up when his parents died
since that time the little front room over the front porch had never been occupied
now a somewhat ragged lad from nowhere was to be put into it
no wonder clemantiny shook her head when miss salome went up to air it
even clemantiny had to admit that chester was willing to work
piled it so neatly that even the grim handmaiden was pleased
she sent him to the garden to pick the early beans
in the evening he milked three cows and did all the chores
falling into the ways of the place with a deft adaptability that went far to soften clemantiny's heart
when i called him chester benson out there in the cowyard
he stared at me fer half a minute sif id called him nebuchadnezzar
later on miss salome came in to see if he was comfortable
i had a little boy once who used to sleep here
something came up in his throat that felt about as big as a pumpkin
at the same moment he wished he could have told miss salome the whole truth about himself
as he watched her figure passing out of the little porch chamber
but on second thought he decided that this would never do
he felt sure she would disapprove of his running away
would probably insist upon his going straight back to upton or
but when she came into the kitchen the next morning the fire was already made and chester was out in the yard with three of the five cows milked
but she gave him cream with his porridge that morning
all miss salome's hired hands got from clemantiny was skim milk
miss salome's regular hired man lived in a little house down in the hollow
the other two men she had hired for harvest also arrived
but just you keep an eye on him all the same
even clemantiny had to admit that he earned every cent of his wages
his active feet were untiring and his wiry arms could pitch and stock with the best
made on his own responsibility a round of barns and outhouses to make sure that everything was snug and tight for the night
it was hardly fair to put the bones in now
upton drudgery and that dreadful week in montrose seemed like a bad dream
still threw her words at him as if they were so many missiles warranted to strike home
but chester soon learned that clemantiny's bark was worse than her bite
she was really very good to him and fed him lavishly
but she declared that this was only to put some flesh on him
it offends me to see bones sticking through anybody's skin like that
we aren't used to such objects at mount hope farm
ill admit that he knows how to make himself useful
but i don't trust him any more than ever i did
you can't get any more out of him than juice out of a post
but it was miss salome who had won chester's whole heart
he had never loved anybody in his hard little life before
he forgot that he was working to earn money and make his fortune
his starved heart thawed and expanded in the sunshine of her atmosphere
she went to the little porch room every night to kiss him good night
chester would have been bitterly disappointed if she had failed to go
she was greatly shocked to find out that he had never said his prayers before going to bed
she insisted on teaching him the simple little one she had used herself when a child
there was nothing he would not have done for miss salome
she talked a good deal to him about johnny and she gave him the jackknife that johnny had owned
one day he heard miss salome speaking of someone who had run away from home
chester blushed until his freckles were drowned out in a sea of red
when did anything ever escape those merciless black eyes of clemantiny's
do you think it's always wrong for a fellow to run away
but if he wasn't treated well and was jawed at and not let go to school
clemantiny gave miss salome a look as of one who would say
youre batblind if you can't read between the lines of that but miss salome was placidly unconscious
she was not really thinking of the subject at all
did not guess that chester meant anything more than generalities
nothing can justify a boy for running away especially as jarvis colemen did never even left a word behind him to say where hed gone
don't suppose she would have grieved much if he had
until he felt as if she were boring into his very soul and reading all his past life
he hated to think of leaving mount hope farm and miss salome
he would have been content to stay there and work as hard as he had ever worked at upton
merely for the roof over his head and the food he ate
the making of a fortune seemed a small thing compared to the privilege of being near miss salome
in the tone she might have used to a spoiled child
but if youd take my advice which you won't and never do youd write to somebody in upton and make inquiries about him first
what he says is all very well and he sticks to it marvellous
i suppose you think that covers a multitude of sins
on the day when the last load of rustling golden sheaves was carried into the big barn and stowed away in the dusty loft
now he was to be paid his wages and sent away
martin had told him that morning that a man in east hopedale wanted a boy for a spell
would see that he got the place if he wanted it
but that did not reconcile him to leaving mount hope farm
miss salome was sitting in her favourite sunny corner of the kitchen and clemantiny was flying around with double briskness
the latter's thin lips were tightly set and disapproval was writ large in every flutter of her calico skirts
for a moment he felt as he had felt when he left the provision store in montrose
but wouldn't you rather stay here with me for the winter
he heard clemantiny give a snort behind him and mutter
we really need a chore boy all the year round
martin has all he can do with the heavy work
you shall have your board and clothes for doing the odd jobs
in the spring we will see what need be done then
ill try to do everything you want me to do
as she set a pan of apples on the stove with an emphatic thud
she put her arms about chester and drew him to her
of course i shall expect you to be a good boy
that day was the beginning of a new life for him
he began to go to the hopedale school the next week
miss salome gave him all johnny's old school books and took an eager interest in his studies
he could not help thinking that he had really deceived miss salome
he felt sure that miss salome would view that with horror
as the time passed by and he learned more and more what a high standard of honour and truth she had
chester felt as guilty as if he had systematically deceived her with intent to do harm
he began to wish that he had the courage to tell her the whole truth about himself
he began to think that perhaps he had not done right
in miss salome's code nothing could be right that was underhanded
chester was very swiftly coming to look at things through miss salome's eyes
he felt sure that johnny would never have acted as he had
it was to be as good and manly a fellow as johnny must have been
but he could never be that as long as he kept the truth about himself from miss salome
i don't suppose he has robbed a bank or murdered anybody
she was fated not to know for a fortnight longer
during that time chester fought out his struggle with himself
he knew that it would mean going back to upton and aunt harriet and the old
but he would not sail under false colours any longer
chester went into the kitchen one afternoon when he came home from school
with his lips set and his jaws even squarer than usual
turning to him with her spoon poised in midair over her granite saucepan
my name isn't benson exactly and i ran away from home
she she wasn't kind to me and she wouldn't let me go to school so i ran away
clemantiny turned to miss salome with an air of surrendering a dearly cherished opinion
i guess you must be right about his looking like johnny
for he that very fellow there and johnny are first cousins
i knew his father as well as i know you
sit down don't stand there looking as if you were on trial for your life
chester sat down and told them all about it his moonlight flitting and his adventures in montrose
miss salome exclaimed with horror over the fact of his sleeping in a pile of lumber for seven nights
it would have been better for you to have told as straight a story at first
i dare say your aunt was severe with you but two wrongs never make a right
what on earth do you want to send him back for
let harriet elwell look somewhere else for somebody to scold
you have as much claim on him as harriet elwell has
she ain't any real relation to him any more than you are
as he stood there with his flushed face and wistful eyes
if you think you ought to go back to your aunt
chester wished she had not left the decision to him
your aunt is willing to let you stay with me
a woman's likely to give up a boy like chester a good
steady worker and as respectful and obliging as there is between this and sunset very likely
this taffy is all burnt to the saucepan and clean ruined but what's the odds
is that the next time you adopt a boy and let him twine himself round a person's heart
youll make sure first that you are going to stick to it
i don't like having my affections torn up by the roots
clemantiny seized the saucepan and disappeared with it into the pantry amid a whirl of pungent smoke
mount hope farm was a strangely dismal place that night
miss salome sighed heavily and often as she made her preparations for the morrow's journey
clemantiny stalked about with her grim face grimmer than ever
when he went to bed that night in the little porch chamber
he would always have a good friend in miss salome aye
clemantiny tiptoed silently in with a candle in her hand and bent over him with an expression of almost maternal tenderness on her face
it was late and an aroma of boiling sugar hung about her
she had sat up long after miss salome was abed
to boil another saucepan of taffy for chester to eat on his journey
it's a shame in salome to insist on his going back
salome thinks she was only just a little bit cranky
leave their team there and take the boat for belltown
chester bade farewell to the porch chamber and the long
white kitchen and the friendly barns with a full heart
clemantiny put a big bagful of taffy into his hands
then clemantiny went back into the kitchen and cried good
clear and sunny but neither chester nor miss salome was in a mood for enjoyment
they stayed in belltown overnight and in the morning took the train to roxbury station
here miss salome hired a team from the storekeeper and drove out to upton
chester felt his heart sink as they drove into the elwell yard
miss salome tied her hired nag to the gatepost and took chester by the hand
it was opened with a jerk andmistress elwell stood before them
for she uttered no word of surprise at seeing chester again
i have had him hired for some time on my farm at hopedale
but i didn't know until yesterday that he had run away from you
i thought he ought to come straight back and return your four dollars
thinks he can come back now that it's all done and loaf all winter
her gentle nature was grievously stirred by the heartlessness shown in the face and voice ofmistress elwell
but he shall not want for a home as long as i have one to give him
but she wished for a moment that clemantiny was there
miss salome thought she could have enjoyed a tilt between her ancient handmaid andmistress elwell
you provoked me more than was becoming by your remarks
not until they reached the main road did she trust herself to speak to the dazed lad beside her
but im gladder than words can say that she wouldn't take you back
i want you to call me aunt salome after this
he had never felt so glad and grateful in his life before
they got home that night just as the sun was setting redly behind the great maples on the western hill
gazing at them over the high board fence of the cowyard
she set down her pail and came out to the lane on a run
she caught chester as he sprang from the wagon and gave him a hearty hug
im glad clean down to my boot soles to see you back again
youd better go in and study up your lessons for tomorrow
the strike at putney the church at putney was one that gladdened the hearts of all the ministers in the presbytery whenever they thought about it
while other churches here and there were continually giving trouble in one way or another
the putneyites were never guilty of brewing up internal or presbyterial strife
the exeter church people were always quarrelling among themselves and carrying their quarrels to the courts of the church
the very name of exeter gave the members of presbytery the cold creeps
no minister ever stayed in danbridge longer than he could help
were disposed to think that the millennium would come if ever the danbridgians got a minister whom they liked
at putney they had had the same minister for fifteen years and hoped and expected to have him for fifteen more
they looked with horrorstricken eyes on the danbridge theological coquetries
bloom valley church was over head and heels in debt and had no visible prospect of ever getting out
the moderator said under his breath that they did overmuch praying and too little hoeing
tarrytown road kept its head above water but never had a cent to spare for missions or the schemes of the church
in bright and shining contradistinction to these the putney church had always paid its way and gave liberally to all departments of church work
if other springs of supply ran dry the putneyites enthusiastically got up a tea or a social
naturally the heft of this work fell on the women
the putney women had the reputation of being great church workers
putting on airs at conventions among the less energetic women of the other churches
there was a mission band and a helping hand among the children
out of which the whole trouble grew which convulsed the church at putney for a brief time and furnished a standing joke in presbyterial circles for years afterwards
to this day ministers and elders tell the story of the putney church strike with sparkling eyes and subdued chuckles
unregenerate heart of man to make a jest of his own bitter defeat
it was in june that the secretary of the putney w
auxiliary wrote to a noted returned missionary who was touring the country
asking her to give an address on mission work before their society
cotterell wrote back saying that her brief time was so taken up already that she found it hard to make any further engagements
but she could not refuse the putney people who were so well and favourably known in mission circles for their perennial interest and liberality
on the sunday referred to there was to be no evening service in the church owing to mister sinclair's absence
as the classroom was too small for the expected audience
the elders of the church rose up to a man and declared that no woman should occupy the pulpit of the putney church
it was in direct contravention to the teachings of st
he said that he could not conscientiously give his consent to a woman occupying his pulpit
even when that woman wasmistress cotterell and her subject foreign missions
out of doors the world basked in june sunshine and preened itself in blossom
the birds sang and chirped in the lichened maples that cupped the little church in
being too wrought up in her mind to sit in her chair at the desk
all the arrangements are made andmistress cotterell is coming on the tenth
how can we tell her that the men won't let her speak
there was never anything like this in putney church before
i always said that man would make trouble here yet
i don't see what business the men have to interfere with us anyhow
one would think we were still in the dark ages
im more surprised at mister sinclair than at the elders
but mister sinclair has always seemed so liberal and broadminded
you never can tell what crotchet an old bachelor will take into his head
mister sinclair's inveterate celibacy was a standing grievance with the putney women
if he had a wife who could be our president this would never have happened
they must talk themselves out before they can get down to business
but she thought the time had now come to speak
we can talk and rage against the men all day if we like
all the neighbouring auxiliaries notified and the men won't let us have the church
how are we going to get out of the scrape
the eyes of every woman present turned to myra wilson
but when it came to action they had a fashion of turning to myra
she was sitting on the sill of the window across from lucy knox
there was a sparkle in her grey eyes that boded ill to the men who were peaceably pursuing their avocations
rashly indifferent to what the women might be saying in the mapleshaded classroom
when elder knox went in to tea that evening he glanced somewhat apprehensively at his wife
they had had an altercation before she went to the meeting
he supposed she had talked herself into another rage while there
she had made his favourite soda biscuits for him and inquired amiably after his progress in hoeing turnips in the southeast meadow
when the biscuits and the maple syrup and two cups of matchless tea had nerved the elder up
his curiosity got the better of his prudence for even elders are human and curiosity knows no gender and he asked what they had done at the meeting
we talked the matter over very quietly and came to the conclusion that the session knew best and that women hadn't any right to interfere in church business at all
lucy knox turned her head away to hide a smile
he was a peaceloving man and disliked ructions of any sort and domestic ones in particular
since the decision of the sessionmistress knox had made his life a burden to him
i was afraid youd work yourselves up at that meeting and let myra wilson or alethea craig put you up to some foolishness or other
i guess ill jog down to the corner this evening and order that barrel of pastry flour you want
but i thought you said you had to have some to bake for the social week after next
they would speedily pay off by a big cake and icecream social in the hall
knox had been one of the foremost promoters of the enterprise
then how is the money for the carpet to be got
if women aren't good enough to speak in church they are not good enough to work for it either
lucy dear passed the cookies and then rose abruptly and left the table
theyre mad at us now and doing this to pay us out
but theyll cool down later on and well have the social all right
i was always opposed to this action of the session
it wouldn't have hurt to have let the woman speak
the minister youre not going to set your opinion up against his
didn't know they taught such reverence for ministers in danbridge
on sunday morning the men were conscious of a bare
after some inward wondering he concluded that it was because there were no flowers anywhere
said john robbins in an angry undertone to his daughter polly
what in the name of common sense is the good of your flower banders if you can't keep the place looking decent
it was well for polly that she was too big to have her ears boxed
it might not have saved her if they had been anywhere else than in church
meanwhile the men who were sitting in the choir three basses and two tenors were beginning to dimly suspect that there was something amiss here too
myra wilson and alethea craig and several other members of the choir were sitting down in their pews with perfectly unconscious faces
myra was looking out of the window into the tangled sunlight and shadow of the great maples
she slipped demurely into her father's pew at one side of the pulpit
who was the putney singing master and felt himself responsible for the choir
but she was absorbed in reading the mission report she had found in the rack
eben was finally forced to tiptoe down to the spenslow pew and whisper
placid voice was audible not only to those in the nearby pews
you know if a woman isn't fit to speak in the church she can't be fit to sing in it either
nobody who heard the singing in putney church that day ever forgot it
there were no announcements of society meetings for the forthcoming week
on the way home from church that day irate husbands and fathers scolded
one and all met with the same calm statement that if a noble
selfsacrificing woman likemistress cotterell were not good enough to speak in the putney church
everyday women could not be fit to take any part whatever in its work
out of all the corps of teachers only one was a man
in the christian endeavour meeting on tuesday night the feminine element sat dumb and unresponsive
at the end of that time they happened to meet at the manse and talked the matter over with the harassed minister
my authority has been set at naught in my own household
im laughed at if i show my face in any of the other settlements
the sunday school superintendent said the sunday school was going to wrack and ruin
the condition of the church for dust was something scandalous
he supposed they would have to let the women have their own way
the next sunday evening after service mister sinclair arose hesitatingly
alethea craig always declared that he looked just plain everyday cross
he announced briefly that the session after due deliberation had concluded thatmistress cotterell might occupy the pulpit on the evening appointed for her address
frances spenslow got up and went to the organ stool
the singing in the last hymn was good and hearty
going down the steps after dismissalmistress elder knox caught the secretary of the church aid by the arm
youd better call a special meeting of the aids at my house tomorrow afternoon
if were to get that social over before haying begins weve got to do some smart scurrying
the unhappiness of miss farquhar frances farquhar was a beauty and was sometimes called a society butterfly by people who didn't know very much about it
her father was wealthy and her mother came of an extremely blueblooded family
she had been engaged to paul holcomb he was a very handsome fellow
frances was very deeply in love with him or thought herself so
which at the time comes to pretty much the same thing
the simple truth was that holcomb was fickle and had fallen in love with another girl
it did not matter to his sublimely selfish caddishness whether he broke frances farquhar's heart or not
he got his freedom and he married maud carroll in six months time
who was frances's older brother and seldom concerned himself about her except when the family honour was involved
she cried and said it would ruin frances's future prospects
the girl herself took no part in the family indignation meetings
after a while the farquhars calmed down and devoted themselves to the task of cheering frances up
she got through the rest of the season somehow and showed a proud front to the world
but the same might be said of a score of other girls who were not suspected of having broken hearts
the whole family took turns coaxing her and had nothing to show for their pains
im going up to windy meadows to stay with aunt eleanor while you are at the harbour
i want to get somewhere where people won't look at me and talk about that
with a sort of fagend by way of a little fishing village
who have perfectly mastered the art of minding their own business exclusively
she knew that her niece had had some love trouble or other
it's always best to let those things take their course
shell get over it in time though she doesn't think so now
for the first fortnight frances revelled in a luxury of unhindered sorrow
if she wished without having to stop because people might notice that her eyes were red
but it would not do to have the girl die on her hands
frances was getting paler and thinner every day and she was spoiling her eyelashes by crying
that i could go and take corona sherwood out for a drive today
trying to realize that there was actually someone in the world besides herself who was to be pitied
she offered to go and take miss sherwood out driving
she saw frances drive off that afternoon with a great deal of satisfaction
say for me that she isn't to go messing about among those shore people until she's perfectly well
the manse is the fourth house after you turn the third corner
frances kept count of the corners and the houses and found the manse
her eyes brightened with delight when frances told her errand
i am not strong enough to walk far yet or do anything useful
he has been so sick aunt eleanor positively forbade that
miss eleanor blames my poor shore people for making me sick at first
he has been ill for some time with some disease of the spine and he is worse lately
im sure miss eleanor won't mind my calling just to see him
frances turned grey tom down the shore road that ran to the cove and past it to silvery
jacky hart's home proved to be a tiny little place overflowing with children
farseeing eyes so often found among the women who watch sea and shore every day and night of their lives for those who sometimes never return
she told all her troubles unreservedly to corona in her monotonous voice
her man was drinking again and the mackerel catch was poor
whenmistress hart asked corona to go in and see jacky
hart stood at the foot of the bed with her tragic face
but if to sit by the child and give him his medicine regularly is all that is necessary
ill come and sit up with jacky tonight if you care to have me
took it all so much as a matter of course
that frances had not the courage to display her wonder
they had their drive through the great green bowl of the country valley
afterwards corona made frances go home with her to tea
was training his sweet peas in the way they should go against the garden fence
he was in his shirt sleeves and wore a big straw hat
he took grey tom away and put him in the barn
so that frances did not see him again until she went home
but she went and sat up with jacky hart that night
when the sea was a shimmer of fairy tints and the boats were coming in from the fishing grounds
later on she found herself watching alone by his bed
there was loud laughing and talking until a late hour
through which the lap of the waves on the sands and the faroff moan of the atlantic surges came sonorously
frances listened to him with a newborn power of sympathy
he told her all the tragedy of his short life
about dad's taking to drink and mammy's having to work so hard
the maternal instinct of the true woman awoke in her
once in the night he told frances that he thought the angels must look like her
you look like a picture i once saw on mister sherwood's table when i was up at the manse one day fore i got so bad i couldn't walk
it was a woman with a li'l baby in her arms and a kind of rim round her head
but i do wish youd come here just once every day and sit here five minutes and let me look at you just that
she said and a look of ineffable content came over the thin little face
i knew you were good as good as miss c'rona
elliott sherwood came splashing along in a little twowheeled gig and picked her up
the minister of the fashionable uptown church which she attended was a portly
cultured sermons and was as far removed from frances's personal life as a star in the milky way
but a minister who wore rubber coats and little caps and drove about in a twowheeled gig
who talked about the shore people as if they were household intimates of his
that the crisp brown hair under the edges of the unclericallooking cap curled around a remarkably wellshaped forehead
beneath which flashed out a pair of very fine darkgrey eyes he had likewise a good mouth
which was resolute and looked as if it might be stubborn on occasion and
slippery rubber apron of his conveyance about her and then proceeded to ask questions
then mister sherwood took out a notebook and looked over its entries intently
do you want any more work of that sort to do
he talked to her as he might have done to corona
seemed utterly oblivious of the fact that her profile was classic and her eyes delicious
his indifference piqued frances a little in spite of her murdered heart
if there was anything she could do she might as well do it
gave her directions for finding some old lady who lived on the elm creek road and to whom corona had read tracts
she is half blind and has missed corona very much
there were other matters also a dozen or so of factory girls who needed to be looked after and a family of ragged children to be clothed
from whose windows people were peering to see what girl the minister was driving
but elliott sherwood drove a full mile out of his way that morning to take her home
risked being late for a very important appointment from which it may be inferred that he was not quite so blind to the beautiful as he had seemed
frances went through the rain that afternoon and read tracts to aunt clorinda
she was so dreadfully tired that night that she forgot to cry
in the morning she went to church for the first time since coming to windy meadows
mentally wondered why such a man had been allowed to remain for four years in a little country pulpit
later on aunt eleanor told her it was for his health
i expect he will soon be gobbled up by some of your city churches
during that time frances thought that she must have been recreated
loving each other with the intensity of exceptional and somewhat exclusive natures
he had got into a ridiculous habit of going to her her
agreed with that model domestic when she said workll keep folks out of trouble and helpem out of it when they are in
just as long as that girl brooded over her own worries and didn't think of anyone but herself she was miserable
but as soon as she found other folks were unhappy
it is plain to be seen that the minister thinks there isn't the like of her on this planet
frances had gone up to stay all night with corona at the manse
they were sitting in the moonlit gloom of corona's room
she had expected to feel badly and cry a little while she told it
it did not seem as if it were worth telling after all
but what she did say put frances on better terms with herself
once i thought i never would but the truth is
because i don't think you ever really loved that man at all
elliott says you can do anything you like with them
frances laughed and said she was not at all good
when she was brushing her hair before the mirror and smiling absently at her reflection
what is it like to be as pretty as you are
elliott says you are the most beautiful girl he has ever seen
for a girl who has told herself a dozen times that she would never care again for masculine admiration
frances experienced a very odd thrill of delight on hearing that the minister of windy meadows thought her beautiful
she knew he admired her intellect and had immense respect for what he called her genius for influencing people
he could not have told whether she was a whit better looking than kitty martin of the cove
who taught a class in sunday school and had round rosy cheeks and a snub nose
one day jacky hart died drifted out with the ebb tide
when the time to go home came frances felt dull
she hated to leave windy meadows and corona and her dear shore people and aunt eleanor and and well
elliott sherwood came up the night before she went away
golden chrysanthemums in her hair shone like stars in the blueblack coils
elliott sherwood had been absent from windy meadows for several days
i have just received a call to castle street church
so corona and i will be in town this winter
elliott sherwood came close up to her as she stood by the window in the fading light
said but on second thoughts i shall not record what he said or what she said either
the summer term had just opened in the maitland district
had no doubt of her own ability to get and keep the school in good working order
the children seem bright and teachable and not hard to control
there are no bad children in the school except the cropper boys and they can be good enough if they like
i think it only fair to tell you that you may have trouble with those boys when they do come
when a cropper is set there is nothing on earth can change him
he's started in with a spite at you on general principles
she could not believe that mister cropper would carry his prejudices into a personal application
this conviction was strengthened when he overtook her walking from school the next day and drove her home
said he had two young rascals of his own to send soon
she thought that mister baxter had exaggerated matters a little
that plum tree ofmistress charley's is loaded with fruit again this year
i came past it today on my way cross lots home from the woods
i don't suppose poormistress charley will get one of them any more than she ever has
i don't say isaac cropper steals those plums with his own hands
but he knows who does and the plums go into mehitable cropper's preserving kettle there's nothing surer
when charley died there was a tremendous fuss about the property
there was a strip of disputed land between the two farms
there's a big plum tree growing on it close to the line fence
when the plums are anything like ripemistress charley discovers some day that there isn't one left on the tree
she has never been able to get a scrap of proof as to who took them
but nobody in maitland has any doubt in his own mind that isaac cropper knows where those plums go
he claims the land and says the plums are his
i don't doubt that he is quite clear in his own mind that they are
id give considerable to see the old sinner fairly caught
i think mister baxter is too hard on mister cropper
during that time the cropper boys had come to school
but before long a subtle spirit of insubordination began to make itself felt in the school
the other pupils thought themselves at liberty to follow this example
in a month's time poor esther had completely lost control of her little kingdom
some complaints were heard among the ratepayers and even mister baxter looked dubious
she knew that unless she could regain her authority she would be requested to hand in her resignation
but she was baffled by the elusive system of defiance which the cropper boys had organized
one day she resolved to go to mister cropper himself and appeal to his sense of justice
when she had been absent at the noon hour all the desks in the schoolroom had been piled in a pyramid on the floor
when questioned every pupil denied having done or helped to do it
alfred and bob cropper looked her squarely in the eyes and declared their innocence in their usual gentlemanly fashion
yet esther felt sure that they were the guilty ones
she also knew what exaggerated accounts of the affair would be taken home to maitland tea tables
that gentleman himself came in from the harvest field looking as courtly as usual
esther was not to be turned from her object thus
although she felt her courage ebbing away from her as it always did in the presence of the cropper imperviousness
i have come up to see you about alfred and robert
as a rule i do not think alfred and robert have been troublesome to their teachers
perhaps you will pardon my saying that a teacher should be able to enforce her orders
i have always said i considered it advisable to employ a male teacher in maitland school
not that i disapprove of you personally far from it
but i have heard many complaints regarding the order in school at present
i believe that if you were willing to cooperate with me that i could govern them
when i send my boys to school i naturally expect that the teacher will be capable of doing the work she has been hired to do
boys soon know when they can disobey a teacher with impunity
no doubt you will be able to secure a school easier to control and will do good work
she felt that she must get away at once or she would burst into heartsick tears under those steely
when she got home she shut herself up in her room and cried
on the following saturday esther went for an afternoon walk
passing through a grove of maples she came out among leafy young saplings on the other side
then an odd smile gleamed over her face and she lifted her kodak
i went out with my kodak and was lucky enough to get a good negative
she rose and placed the proof on the table before mister cropper
bob and alf cropper were up among the boughs picking the plums
on the ground beneath them stood their father with a basket of fruit in his hand
mister cropper looked at the proof and from it to esther
but i am tired of fighting over them and i had decided before this that id let her have them after this
about that little matter we were discussing the other night
ill talk to alfred and robert and see what i can do
the matter of the plums isn't my business and i don't wish to be involved in your family feuds
especially as you say that you mean to allowmistress charley to enjoy her own in future
from that time out the cropper boys were models of good behaviour and the other turbulent spirits
you seem to have won old cropper over to your side entirely
he said at the meeting today that you were the best teacher we had ever had and moved to raise your salary
i never knew isaac cropper to change his opinions so handsomely
mowgli's brothers now rann the kite brings home the night that mang the bat sets free the herds are shut in byre and hut for loosed till dawn are we
nightsong in the jungle it was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the seeonee hills when father wolf woke up from his day's rest
spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips
mother wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling
the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived
he was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined good luck go with you
good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world
the dishlicker and the wolves of india despise tabaqui because he runs about making mischief
eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbishheaps
then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone
even the tiger runs and hides when little tabaqui goes mad
for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature
but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast
where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it
i might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning
tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces
it pleased him to see mother and father wolf look uncomfortable
he will hunt among these hills for the next moon
shere khan was the tiger who lived near the waingunga river
father wolf began angrily by the law of the jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning
he will frighten every head of game within ten miles
his mother did not call him lungri lsb the lame one rsb for nothing
he has been lame in one foot from his birth
now the villagers of the waingunga are angry with him
they will scour the jungle for him when he is far away
we and our children must run when the grass is set alight
below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry
singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it
does he think that our buck are like his fat waingunga bullocks
the whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass
it was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open
makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger
are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat man
forbids every beast to eat man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill
then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe
hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches
the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things
they say too and it is true that maneaters become mangy
then there was a howl an untigerish howl from shere khan
father wolf ran out a few paces and heard shere khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub
the fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter's campfire
you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world the wolf checked in midspring
he made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at
the result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet
stood a naked brown baby who could just walk as soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolf's cave at night
though father wolf's jaws closed right on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs
the baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide
was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among her children
i have heard now and again of such a thing
i could kill him with a touch of my foot
the moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave
for shere khan's great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance
but father wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by
shere khan's shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room
as a man's would be if he tried to fight in a barrel
the man's cub is ours to kill if we choose
am i to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair dues
mother wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward
he shall live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack and in the end
hunter of little naked cubs frogeater fishkiller he shall hunt thee
he had almost forgotten the days when he won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolves
when she ran in the pack and was not called the demon for compliment's sake
for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground
when he was clear he shouted each dog barks in his own yard
we will see what the pack will say to this fostering of mancubs
father wolf said to her gravely shere khan speaks this much truth
he has pushed one of my babes to one side already
that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge
o thou mowgli for mowgli the frog i will call thee the time will come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he has hunted thee
the law of the jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may
but as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the pack council
which is generally held once a month at full moon
after that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please
until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the pack kills one of them
the punishment is death where the murderer can be found and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so
father wolf waited till his cubs could run a little
below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color
from badgercolored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black threeyearolds who thought they could
the lone wolf had led them for a year now
he had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth
once he had been beaten and left for dead so he knew the manners and customs of men
the cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat
now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub
sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked
akela from his rock would cry ye know the law ye know the law
the anxious mothers would take up the call look look well
at last and mother wolf's neck bristles lifted as the time came father wolf pushed mowgli the frog
where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight
a muffled roar came up from behind the rocks the voice of shere khan crying the cub is mine
what have the free people to do with a man's cub
what have the free people to do with the orders of any save the free people
a young wolf in his fourth year flung back shere khan's question to akela what have the free people to do with a man's cub
the law of the jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the pack
he must be spoken for by at least two members of the pack who are not his father and mother
there was no answer and mother wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight
then the only other creature who is allowed at the pack council baloo
the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the law of the jungle old baloo
who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey rose upon his hind quarters and grunted
but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk
nobody cared to cross his path for he was as cunning as tabaqui
but he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree
but the law of the jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub
the life of that cub may be bought at a price
the law does not say who may or may not pay that price
he may make better sport for you when he is grown
if ye will accept the man's cub according to the law
he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one
at last they all went down the hill for the dead bull
for he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over to him
for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune
a help in time of need for none can hope to lead the pack forever
he was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler
till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up to be killed in his turn
that is how mowgli was entered into the seeonee wolf pack for the price of a bull and on baloo's good word
now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years
only guess at all the wonderful life that mowgli led among the wolves
because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books
every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a tree
every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man
when he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept
when he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools and when he wanted honey he climbed up for it
but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape
there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf
at other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends
for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats
he would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night
but he had a mistrust of men because bagheera showed him a square box with a drop gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it
he loved better than anything else to go with bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest
as soon as he was old enough to understand things
bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the pack at the price of a bull's life
he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons
who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat
mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not a creature to be trusted
but though a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour
mowgli forgot it because he was only a boy though he would have called himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue
shere khan was always crossing his path in the jungle
for as akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the younger wolves of the pack
a thing akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds
then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man's cub
that at council ye dare not look him between the eyes
once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill him some day
mowgli would laugh and answer i have the pack and i have thee and baloo
it was one very warm day that a new notion came to bagheera born of something that he had heard
perhaps ikki the porcupine had told him but he said to mowgli when they were deep in the jungle
as the boy lay with his head on bagheera's beautiful black skin
how often have i told thee that shere khan is thy enemy
as many times as there are nuts on that palm
shere khan is all long tail and loud talk like mao
baloo knows it i know it the pack know it and even the foolish
tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that i was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pignuts
but i caught tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palmtree to teach him better manners
he would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely
soon the day comes when he can not kill his buck
many of the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought to the council first are old too
what is a man that he should not run with his brothers
there is no wolf of ours from whose paws i have not pulled a thorn
bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes
where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair
there is no one in the jungle that knows that i
carry that mark the mark of the collar and yet
it was among men that my mother died in the cages of the king's palace at oodeypore
it was because of this that i paid the price for thee at the council when thou wast a little naked cub
they fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night i felt that i was bagheera the panther and no man's plaything
i broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away
i became more terrible in the jungle than shere khan
so thou must go back to men at last to the men who are thy brothers if thou art not killed in the council
but why but why should any wish to kill me
the big panther turned his head away in half a minute
the others they hate thee because their eyes can not meet thine because thou art wise because thou hast pulled out thorns from their feet because thou art a man
by thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man
go thou down quickly to the men's huts in the valley
take some of the red flower which they grow there
so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger friend than i or baloo or those of the pack that love thee
only no creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper name
o my bagheera he slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big eyes art thou sure that all this is shere khan's doing
never was a blacker hunting than that froghunt of thine ten years ago
he came to the cave as the evening mist rose
knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog
the lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold
for mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot
but dashed on and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived
as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by the window of a hut
tomorrow is one day both for akela and for me
then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the hearth
he saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps
when the morning came and the mists were all white and cold
he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with earth
so he strode round the corner and met the boy
disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear
blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do
this thing will die if i do not give it things to eat and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff
halfway up the hill he met bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat
i have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff
presently the red flower blossomed at the end of it
i remember now if it is not a dream how
all that day mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked
in the evening when tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the council rock
akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the leadership of the pack was open
shere khan with his following of scrapfed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered
shere khan began to speak a thing he would never have dared to do when akela was in his prime
the leadership of the pack is with the pack alone
he has kept our law and at last the seniors of the pack thundered let the dead wolf speak
when a leader of the pack has missed his kill
he is called the dead wolf as long as he lives
for twelve seasons i have led ye to and from the kill
in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed
ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known
your right is to kill me here on the council rock
who comes to make an end of the lone wolf
for no single wolf cared to fight akela to the death
he has broken no word of the law of the jungle
i paid for him with a bull when he was accepted
but bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps fight for
no man's cub can run with the people of the jungle
ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep
but for the sake of the honor of the pack
a little matter that by being without a leader ye have forgotten
i promise that if ye let the mancub go to his own place
most of the wolves began to gather round shere khan
yawned in the face of the council but he was furious with rage and sorrow
the wolves had never told him how they hated him
ye have told me so often tonight that i am a man
that matter is with me and that we may see the matter more plainly
have brought here a little of the red flower which ye
some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up
as all the council drew back in terror before the leaping flames
mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled
the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life
gave one piteous look at mowgli as the boy stood all naked
his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver
i go from you to my own people if they be my own people
i promise that when i am a man among men i will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me
there shall be no war between any of us in the pack
but here is a debt to pay before i go
he strode forward to where shere khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames
this cattlekiller said he would kill me in the council because he had not killed me when i was a cub
he beat shere khan over the head with the branch
the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear
but remember when next i come to the council rock
it will be with shere khan's hide on my head
nor do i think that ye will sit here any longer
the fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch
the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur
as he had never been hurt in his life before
so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break and he had never cried in all his life before
he went to the cave where she lived with father wolf
come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man
we will talk to thee and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night
i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs
when i come it will be to lay out shere khan's hide upon the council rock
the dawn was beginning to break when mowgli went down the hillside alone
huntingsong of the seeonee pack as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled once
a doe leaped up from the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup
a wolf stole back to carry the word to the waiting pack
we sought and we found and we bayed on his track once
as the dawn was breaking the wolf pack yelled once
kaa's hunting his spots are the joy of the leopard his horns are the buffalo's pride
for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide
or the heavybrowed sambhur can gore ye need not stop work to inform us we knew it ten seasons before
says the cub in the pride of his earliest kill but the jungle is large and the cub he is small
maxims of baloo all that is told here happened some time before mowgli was turned out of the seeonee wolf pack
it was in the days when baloo was teaching him the law of the jungle
old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil
for the young wolves will only learn as much of the law of the jungle as applies to their own pack and tribe
all these things are the marks of our brothers except tabaqui the jackal and the hyaena whom we hate
sometimes bagheera the black panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on
would purr with his head against a tree while mowgli recited the day's lesson to baloo
the boy could climb almost as well as he could swim
whenever one of the junglepeople hunts outside his own grounds
give me leave to hunt here because i am hungry
all this will show you how much mowgli had to learn by heart
he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times
one day when mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper
who would have spoiled mowgli if he had had his own way
how can his little head carry all thy long talk
is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed
better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than that he should come to harm through ignorance
i am now teaching him the master words of the jungle that shall protect him with the birds and the snake people
look to it then that thou dost not kill the mancub
he is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon
i am more likely to give help than to ask it bagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steelblue
rippingchisel talons at the end of it still i should like to know
i will call mowgli and he shall say them if he will
mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant
adding as he reached the ground i come for bagheera and not for thee
the master words of the jungle that i have taught thee this day
not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old baloo for his teachings
giving the words the bear accent which all the hunting people use
with the kite's whistle at the end of the sentence
drumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at baloo
then he turned aside to tell bagheera how he had begged the master words from hathi the wild elephant
how hathi had taken mowgli down to a pool to get the snake word from a watersnake
how mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in the jungle
mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at bagheera's shoulder fur and kicking hard
when the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice
as the boy lay between the big forepaws he could see the bear was angry
thou hast been talking with the bandarlog the monkey people
mowgli looked at bagheera to see if the panther was angry too
thou hast been with the monkey people the gray apes the people without a law the eaters of everything
the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me
they they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said i was their blood brother except that i had no tail
why have i never been taken among the monkey people
i have taught thee all the law of the jungle for all the peoples of the jungle except the monkeyfolk who live in the trees
but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen
they boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle
but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten
we do not drink where the monkeys drink we do not go where the monkeys go we do not hunt where they hunt we do not die where they die
hast thou ever heard me speak of the bandarlog till today
for the forest was very still now baloo had finished
the junglepeople put them out of their mouths and out of their minds
but we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads
but i still think baloo should have warned thee against them
how was i to guess he would play with such dirt
a fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away
what baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true
there was no occasion for the monkeys and the junglepeople to cross each other's path
would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed
invite the junglepeople to climb up their trees and fight them
leave the dead monkeys where the junglepeople could see them
because their memories would not hold over from day to day
what the bandarlog think now the jungle will think later
but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them
that was why they were so pleased when mowgli came to play with them
they never meant to do any more the bandarlog never mean anything at all but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea
he told all the others that mowgli would be a useful person to keep in the tribe
because he could weave sticks together for protection from the wind so
used to make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came to do it
they were really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungle so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them
therefore they followed baloo and bagheera and mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time for the midday nap
resolving to have no more to do with the monkey people
the next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms hard
little hands and then a swash of branches in his face
then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as baloo woke the jungle with his deep cries and bagheera bounded up the trunk with every tooth bared
the bandarlog howled with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where bagheera dared not follow
all the junglepeople admire us for our skill and our cunning
then they began their flight and the flight of the monkeypeople through treeland is one of the things nobody can describe
all laid out from fifty to seventy or a hundred feet above ground
by these they can travel even at night if necessary
two of the strongest monkeys caught mowgli under the arms and swung off with him through the treetops
had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast
sick and giddy as mowgli was he could not help enjoying the wild rush
though the glimpses of earth far down below frightened him
the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth
his escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost branches crackle and bend under them
then with a cough and a whoop would fling themselves into the air outward and downward
hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next tree
sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green jungle
as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea
then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face
he and his two guards would be almost down to earth again
the whole tribe of bandarlog swept along the treeroads with mowgli their prisoner
then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle
the first thing was to send back word to baloo and bagheera
for he could only see the topsides of the branches
rann the kite balancing and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die
dropped a few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat
he whistled with surprise when he saw mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him give the kite call for we be of one blood
but rann balanced away to the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again
tell baloo of the seeonee pack and bagheera of the council rock
the last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air
but rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust
watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the treetops as mowgli's escort whirled along
who had set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys
what was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him
teacher of the law cubbeater a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee open
roll me into the hives of the wild bees that i may be stung to death
why did i not warn thee against the monkeyfolk instead of breaking thy head
now perhaps i may have knocked the day's lesson out of his mind
he will be alone in the jungle without the master words
baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning
at least he gave me all the words correctly a little time ago
unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport
above all he has the eyes that make the junglepeople afraid
it is true what hathi the wild elephant says to each his own fear and they
the whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold
he sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten
even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats
here baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the panther
they went off to look for kaa the rock python
they found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun
for he had been in retirement for the last ten days changing his skin
now he was very splendid darting his big bluntnosed head along the ground
twisting the thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves
licking his lips as he thought of his dinner to come
as soon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket
he is always a little blind after he has changed his skin
kaa was not a poison snake in fact he rather despised the poison snakes as cowards but his strength lay in his hug
when he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said
like all snakes of his breed kaa was rather deaf
but i i have to wait and wait for days in a woodpath and climb half a night on the mere chance of a young ape
the branches are not what they were when i was young
maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter
i came very near to falling on my last hunt very near indeed and the noise of my slipping
for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree
something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon
they will say anything even that thou hast lost all thy teeth
but baloo and bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of kaa's throat ripple and bulge
when i came up into the sun today i heard them whooping among the treetops
for that was the first time in his memory that one of the junglepeople had owned to being interested in the doings of the monkeys
beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters leaders in their own jungle i am certain on the trail of the bandarlog
i am no more than the old and sometimes very foolish teacher of the law to the seeonee wolfcubs
those nutstealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our mancub of whom thou hast perhaps heard
i heard some news from ikki of a manthing that was entered into a wolf pack
ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told
the best and wisest and boldest of mancubs my own pupil
who shall make the name of baloo famous through all the jungles and besides
there are tales i could tell that that need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly
our mancub is in the hands of the bandarlog now
we know that of all the junglepeople they fear kaa alone
but a manthing in their hands is in no good luck
as well as other things which i can not now say for shame
we must remind them to speak well of their master
baloo looked up to see where the voice came from
sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his wings
but he had ranged all over the jungle looking for the bear and had missed him in the thick foliage
the bandarlog have taken him beyond the river to the monkey city to the cold lairs
i have told the bats to watch through the dark time
to think of one so young remembering the master word for the birds too while he was being pulled across trees
because what they called the cold lairs was an old deserted city
beasts seldom use a place that men have once used
the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live anywhere
no selfrespecting animal would come within eyeshot of it except in times of drought
when the halfruined tanks and reservoirs held a little water
his head and two feet of his neck clearing the water
in the cold lairs the monkeypeople were not thinking of mowgli's friends at all
though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid
some king had built it long ago on a little hill
you could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn
trees had grown into and out of the walls the battlements were tumbled down and decayed
wild creepers hung out of the windows of the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps
the marble of the courtyards and the fountains was split
the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king's elephants used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees
the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on their sides
pretended to despise the junglepeople because they lived in the forest
yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to use them
they would sit in circles on the hall of the king's council chamber
then break off to play up and down the terraces of the king's garden
where they would shake the rose trees and the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall
they explored all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of little dark rooms
they drank at the tanks and made the water all muddy
then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city and went back to the treetops
who had been trained under the law of the jungle
the monkeys dragged him into the cold lairs late in the afternoon
they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs
one of the monkeys made a speech and told his companions that mowgli's capture marked a new thing in the history of the bandarlog
for mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and canes together as a protection against rain and cold
mowgli picked up some creepers and began to work them in and out
the monkeys tried to imitate but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began to pull their friends tails or jump up and down on all fours
i am a stranger in this part of the jungle
twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws
it was too much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit
he roamed through the empty city giving the strangers hunting call from time to time
mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed
all that baloo has said about the bandarlog is true
no leaders nothing but foolish words and little picking thievish hands
but i must try to return to my own jungle
but that is better than chasing silly rose leaves with the bandarlog
no sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back
telling him that he did not know how happy he was
but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were halffull of rain water
there was a ruined summerhouse of white marble in the center of the terrace
the domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the queens used to enter
but the walls were made of screens of marble tracery beautiful milkwhite fretwork
set with agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli
as the moon came up behind the hill it shone through the open work
to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were
we are the most wonderful people in all the jungle
now as you are a new listener and can carry our words back to the junglepeople so that they may notice us in future
we will tell you all about our most excellent selves
the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the bandarlog
whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together this is true we all say so
now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon
if it were only a big enough cloud i might try to run away in the darkness
that same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined ditch below the city wall
knowing well how dangerous the monkeypeople were in large numbers
the monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one
come down swiftly with the slope of the ground in my favor
they will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds
when that cloud covers the moon i shall go to the terrace
they hold some sort of council there over the boy
the big snake was delayed awhile before he could find a way up the stones
as mowgli wondered what would come next he heard bagheera's light feet on the terrace
the black panther had raced up the slope almost without a sound and was striking he knew better than to waste time in biting right and left among the monkeys
who were seated round mowgli in circles fifty and sixty deep
then as bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him
dragged him up the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome
but mowgli fell as baloo had taught him to fall
later we will play with thee if the poisonpeople leave thee alive
he could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him and gave the call a second time
peering through the open work and listening to the furious din of the fight round the black panther the yells and chatterings and scufflings
hoarse cough as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his enemies
baloo must be at hand bagheera would not have come alone
the cry that told him mowgli was safe gave him new courage
then from the ruined wall nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling warshout of baloo
he panted up the terrace only to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys
a crash and a splash told mowgli that bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys could not follow
while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps
ready to spring upon him from all sides if he came out to help baloo
it was then that bagheera lifted up his dripping chin
in despair gave the snake's call for protection we be of one blood
ye and i for he believed that kaa had turned tail at the last minute
half smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the terrace
could not help chuckling as he heard the black panther asking for help
kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall
landing with a wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch
he had no intention of losing any advantage of the ground
to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order
carried the news of the great battle over the jungle
scattered bands of the monkeyfolk woke and came leaping along the treeroads to help their comrades in the cold lairs
the noise of the fight roused all the day birds for miles round
the fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body
or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool
you can roughly imagine what kaa was like when he fought
a python four or five feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest
his first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round baloo
generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories their elders told them of kaa
who could slip along the branches as quietly as moss grows
steal away the strongest monkey that ever lived of old kaa
who could make himself look so like a dead branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived
kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle
for none of them knew the limits of his power
then kaa opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word
the monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped their cries
in the stillness that fell upon the city mowgli heard bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank
they clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they skipped along the battlements
put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owlfashion between his front teeth
get the mancub out of that trap i can do no more
but i think i heard thee call this was to bagheera
i am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings
the curve of the broken dome was above his head
kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot
made two or three light taps with his head to get the distance
then lifting up six feet of his body clear of the ground
the screenwork broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and rubbish
mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between baloo and bagheera an arm around each big neck
licking his lips and looking at the monkeydead on the terrace and round the tank
in a dry voice that mowgli did not at all like
but here is kaa to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life
mowgli turned and saw the great python's head swaying a foot above his own
that i do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when i have newly changed my coat
my kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry
i ask that i may follow when next he goes abroad
but i drive goats toward such as can use them
when thou art empty come to me and see if i speak the truth
i have some skill in these lsb he held out his hands rsb
i may pay the debt which i owe to thee
the python dropped his head lightly for a minute on mowgli's shoulder
what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see
the moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things
baloo went down to the tank for a drink and bagheera began to put his fur in order
as kaa glided out into the center of the terrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all the monkeys eyes upon him
from the walls came a moan like the wind in the treetops we see
begins now the dance the dance of the hunger of kaa
then he began making loops and figures of eight with his body
without thy order we can not stir foot or hand
baloo and bagheera took one stiff step forward with them
mowgli laid his hands on baloo and bagheera to get them away
the two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream
or i must go back must go back to kaa
it is only old kaa making circles on the dust
the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle
many will walk by that road before the moon rises again
who did not know anything of a python's powers of fascination
i saw no more than a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came
neither baloo nor bagheera will be able to hunt with pleasure for many days
but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in good hunting
in hair i am half plucked along my back and last of all
baloo and i were both made stupid as little birds by the hunger dance
baloo did not wish to bring mowgli into any more trouble
bagheera gave him half a dozen lovetaps from a panther's point of view
but for a sevenyearold boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid
one of the beauties of jungle law is that punishment settles all scores
mowgli laid his head down on bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he never waked when he was put down in the homecave
roadsong of the bandarlog here we go in a flung festoon
wouldn't you like if your tails were so curved in the shape of a cupid's bow
thinking of beautiful things we know dreaming of deeds that we mean to do
in a minute or two something noble and wise and good
all the talk we ever have heard uttered by bat or beast or bird hide or fin or scale or feather jabber it quickly and all together
then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines
when mowgli left the wolf's cave after the fight with the pack at the council rock
he went down to the plowed lands where the villagers lived
but he would not stop there because it was too near to the jungle
he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at the council
keeping to the rough road that ran down the valley
followed it at a steady jogtrot for nearly twenty miles
till he came to a country that he did not know
the valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines
at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazinggrounds
stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe
when the little boys in charge of the herds saw mowgli they shouted and ran away
the yellow pariah dogs that hang about every indian village barked
when he came to the village gate he saw the big thornbush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight
for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things to eat
so men are afraid of the people of the jungle here also
ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest
who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at mowgli
so he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd
he is but a wolfchild run away from the jungle
the cubs had often nipped mowgli harder than they intended
there were white scars all over his arms and legs
but he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites
he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger
said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles
she peered at mowgli under the palm of her hand
he knew that messua was wife to the richest villager in the place
so he looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly what the jungle has taken the jungle has restored
forget not to honor the priest who sees so far into the lives of men
but all this talking is like another lookingover by the pack
the crowd parted as the woman beckoned mowgli to her hut
a great earthen grain chest with funny raised patterns on it
an image of a hindu god in a little alcove
she gave him a long drink of milk and some bread
dost thou not remember the day when i gave thee thy new shoes
he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted to get away
now i am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle
as soon as messua pronounced a word mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly
before dark he had learned the names of many things in the hut
because mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut
when they shut the door he went through the window
remember he can never till now have slept on a bed
if he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away
but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under the chin
this is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles
thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle altogether like a man already
all except the wolves that were burned with the red flower
shere khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again
when he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in the waingunga
i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave
but also i will always remember that i have been cast out of the pack
their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond
i will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazingground
for three months after that night mowgli hardly ever left the village gate
he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men
which annoyed him horribly and then he had to learn about money
then the little children in the village made him very angry
the law of the jungle had taught him to keep his temper
for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites
only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two
he did not know his own strength in the least
in the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts
but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull
mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes between man and man
helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at khanhiwara
no one was more pleased than mowgli and that night
because he had been appointed a servant of the village
he went off to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great figtree
there was a hole under the platform where a cobra lived
he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred and the old men sat around the tree and talked
pulled at the big huqas till far into the night
they told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts and buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle
till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads
the deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops
now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight
who naturally knew something about what they were talking of
had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing
buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away messua's son was a ghosttiger
his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked
because purun dass always limped from the blow that he got in a riot when his account books were burned
to talk of the soul of a moneylender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal is child's talk
for the government has set a hundred rupees on his life
buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle
shall i believe the tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen
the custom of most indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning
the very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up to their noses
so long as the boys keep with the herds they are safe
for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle
but if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards
mowgli made it very clear to the children with him that he was the master
to be very careful not to stray away from the herd
an indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little ravines
the buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places
where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours
mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the waingunga came out of the jungle then he dropped from rama's neck
so long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock
so that i can see thee as i come out of the village
when he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak tree in the center of the plain
lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him
herding in india is one of the laziest things in the world
but get down into the muddy pools one after another
work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring chinablue eyes show above the surface
the herd children hear one kite whistling almost out of sight overhead
the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow
almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere
long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them
perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes
pretend that they are kings and the figures are their armies
the buffaloes lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other
they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights
day after day mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows
day after day he would see gray brother's back a mile and a half away across the plain
day after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him
if shere khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the waingunga
at last a day came when he did not see gray brother at the signal place
he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree
he has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard
now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites
but he told me everything before i broke his back
shere khan's plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this evening for thee and for no one else
he thinks that i shall wait till he has slept
if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies
can we get behind his track so that they may smell it
he swam far down the waingunga to cut that off
that opens out on the plain not half a mile from here
i can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of the ravine and then sweep down but he would slink out at the foot
then there lifted up a huge gray head that mowgli knew well
the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the jungle the hunting howl of a wolf at midday
i might have known that thou wouldst not forget me
to charge down and trample the life out of him
but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous
no six men could have divided the herd so neatly
till the sides are higher than shere khan can jump
he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine
if i could only tell him what i need of him today
hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them
crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away
all he wanted to do was to make a big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine
for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and give shere khan warning
at last mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself
from that height you could see across the tops of the trees down to the plain below but what mowgli looked at was the sides of the ravine
he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down
while the vines and creepers that hung over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out
he put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine it was almost like shouting down a tunnel and the echoes jumped from rock to rock
a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the ravine screeching
the herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope
before they were fairly in the bed of the ravine rama winded shere khan and bellowed
they knew what the business was before them the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand
looking from side to side for some way of escape
but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on
the herd splashed through the pool he had just left
mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine
while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting
akela and gray brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes legs
though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again
feeling for the knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men
a boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a tenfoot tiger alone
but mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal's skin is fitted on
the children had told the village about the buffalo stampede
only too anxious to correct mowgli for not taking better care of the herd
the wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming
perhaps i will give thee one of the rupees of the reward when i have taken the skin to khanhiwara
he fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel
most native hunters always singe a tiger's whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them
half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw
so thou wilt take the hide to khanhiwara for the reward
now it is in my mind that i need the skin for my own use
what talk is this to the chief hunter of the village
thy luck and the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill
or he would have gone twenty miles by this time
i will not give thee one anna of the reward
must i stay babbling to an old ape all noon
while mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all india
thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward
there is an old war between this lame tiger and myself a very old war
if he had been ten years younger he would have taken his chance with akela had he met the wolf in the woods
but a wolf who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with maneating tigers was not a common animal
he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect him
expecting every minute to see mowgli turn into a tiger too
i did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy
buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could
looking back over his shoulder in case mowgli should change into something terrible
when he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave
but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body
now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home
heard the conches and bells in the temple blowing and banging
half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate
get hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again
a woman it was messua ran across to the herd
they say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will
this is one of the foolish tales they tell under the big tree at dusk
for i shall send the herd in more swiftly than their brickbats
the buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village
it may be that i have stolen one of them
thank messua that i do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street
he turned on his heel and walked away with the lone wolf
as he looked up at the stars he felt happy
with two wolves at his heels and a bundle on his head
trotting across at the steady wolf's trot that eats up the long miles like fire
then they banged the temple bells and blew the conches louder than ever
buldeo embroidered the story of his adventures in the jungle
till he ended by saying that akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man
the moon was just going down when mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the council rock
but i come with the hide of shere khan to keep my word
mother wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her
when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave
little frog i told him that the hunter would be the hunted
mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where akela used to sit
exactly as he had called when mowgli was first brought there
but they answered the call from habit and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen into
the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet
it was then that mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all by itself
beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left
so mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from that day on
let the jungle listen to the things i have done
at the gates in the twilight he would kill mowgli
lend me thy gay striped coat that i may go to the council rock
by the bull that bought me i made a promise a little promise
only thy coat is lacking before i keep my word
shere khan gives me his coat for the love that he bears me
we will leave the lights of the village and go to the low moon
the jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut
my mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village
these two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the spring
the water comes out of my eyes yet i laugh while it falls
but the hide of shere khan is under my feet
all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan
my heart is heavy with the things that i do not understand
looks downward to find us at rest in the hollows that rustle between
seal lullaby all these things happened several years ago at a place called novastoshnah
told me the tale when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to japan
i took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days till he was fit to fly back to st
the only people who have regular business there are the seals
they come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea
for novastoshnah beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world
a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his shoulders
when he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground
he was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights
but he was always ready for just one fight more
as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face then he would shoot it out like lightning
when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other seal's neck
he only wanted room by the sea for his nursery
but as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring
they fought on the smoothworn basalt rocks of the nurseries
for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men
their wives never came to the island until late in may or early in june
for they did not care to be torn to pieces and the young two
they were called the holluschickie the bachelors and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at novastoshnah alone
sea catch had just finished his fortyfifth fight one spring when matkah
he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation
it was not the fashion for sea catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches
he was scratched and bleeding in twenty places one eye was almost out
why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly
you look as though you had been fighting with the killer whale
i haven't been doing anything but fight since the middle of may
ive met at least a hundred seals from lukannon beach
ive often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at otter island instead of this crowded place
if we went there they would say we were afraid
sea catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for a few minutes
but all the time he was keeping a sharp lookout for a fight
now that all the seals and their wives were on the land
you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest gales
at the lowest counting there were over a million seals on the beach old seals
playing together going down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments
lying over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach
except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rainbowcolored for a little while
but there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely
there never has been such a thing in the world as a white seal
crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their babies you mustn't swim till youre six weeks old
or your head will be sunk by your heels and summer gales and killer whales are bad for baby seals
as bad as bad can be but splash and grow strong
of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first
learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal
the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks
matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat
but then he ate all he could and throve upon it
there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age
the old people in the nurseries took no notice of them
when matkah came back from her deepsea fishing she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb
then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction
striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels right and left
there were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds
so long as you don't lie in muddy water and get mange
or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch
so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea
the first time that kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him out beyond his depth
his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song
if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned
he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled
but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt
he was two weeks learning to use his flippers and all that while he floundered in and out of the water
coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand
until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water
then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions
who eats young seals when he can get them and kotick would head for the beach like an arrow
you will be a holluschickie but this year you must learn how to catch fish
matkah showed kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water
matkah told him he was learning the feel of the water
a school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water
the leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under
when youre south of the sticky water lsb he meant the equator rsb and your tail tingles
that means there's a gale in front of you and you must head north
this was one of very many things that kotick learned
never to stop and look at a boat or a ship
at the end of six months what kotick did not know about deepsea fishing was not worth the knowing
all that time he never set flipper on dry ground
as he was lying half asleep in the warm water somewhere off the island of juan fernandez
just as human people do when the spring is in their legs
he remembered the good firm beaches of novastoshnah seven thousand miles away
as he went on he met scores of his mates
we can dance the firedance in the breakers off lukannon and play on the new grass
so they all came to the beaches where they had been born
that night kotick danced the firedance with the yearling seals
the sea is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from novastoshnah to lukannon
each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps
they talked about the pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in
if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was
the three and fouryearold holluschickie romped down from hutchinson's hill crying out of the way
the sea is deep and you don't know all that's in it yet
just as he was going to roll the speaker over
a couple of blackhaired men with flat red faces came from behind a sand dune
the holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring stupidly
they came from the little village not half a mile from the sea nurseries
they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the killing pens for the seals were driven just like sheep to be turned into sealskin jackets later on
kerick booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke
there has never been a white seal since since i was born
do you really think he is old zaharrof come back
but it's the beginning of the season and they are new to the work
patalamon rattled a pair of seal's shoulder bones in front of a herd of holluschickie and they stopped dead
then he stepped near and the seals began to move
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven
except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year
his eyes nearly popped out of his head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd
that's the first time a seal has ever come to the killinggrounds alone
the distance to the killinggrounds was only half a mile
because if the seals went too fast kerick knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned
till they came to the salt house just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach
but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel
then kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes
kotick could hear the fogdew dripping off the brim of his cap
each with an ironbound club three or four feet long
kerick pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions or too hot
the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made of the skin of a walrus's throat
then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could
ten minutes later little kotick did not recognize his friends any more
for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers
whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile
he turned and galloped back to the sea his little new mustache bristling with horror
where the great sea lions sit on the edge of the surf
he flung himself flipperoverhead into the cool water and rocked there
for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves
you must have seen old kerick polishing off a drove
steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock
i suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it
but if you seals will come here year after year
unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will always be driven
ive followed the poltoos lsb the halibut rsb for twenty years
but look here you seem to have a fondness for talking to your betters suppose you go to walrus islet and talk to sea vitch
if i were you i should haul out and take a nap first
a little low sheet of rocky island almost due northeast from novastoshnah
who has no manners except when he is asleep as he was then
with his hind flippers half in and half out of the surf
he struck the next walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up
so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction but the right one
bobbing in the surf and looking like a little white slug
they all looked at kotick as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy
kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then he had seen enough of it
so he called out isn't there any place for seals to go where men don't ever come
kotick made his dolphinjump in the air and shouted as loud as he could clameater
he knew that sea vitch never caught a fish in his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed though he pretended to be a very terrible person
naturally the chickies and the gooverooskies and the epatkas the burgomaster gulls and the kittiwakes and the puffins
who are always looking for a chance to be rude
so limmershin told me for nearly five minutes you could not have heard a gun fired on walrus islet
while sea vitch rolled from side to side grunting and coughing
how shall i know sea cow when i meet him
he's the only thing in the sea uglier than sea vitch
there he found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover a quiet place for the seals
but none of the other seals had seen the killing
is to grow up and be a big seal like your father
in another five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself
said you will never be able to stop the killing
kotick went off and danced the firedance with a very heavy little heart
that autumn he left the beach as soon as he could
set off alone because of a notion in his bullethead
he was going to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on
so he explored and explored by himself from the north to the south pacific
swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night
he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas
the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years
grow very proud of it but he never met sea cow
with a slope behind it for seals to play on
there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon
or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off
kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again
who told him that kerguelen island was the very place for peace and quiet
when kotick went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy sleetstorm with lightning and thunder
yet as he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once been a seal nursery
it was so in all the other islands that he visited
when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary islands
where he was nearly baked to death he went to the georgia islands
even to a little speck of an island south of the cape of good hope
but everywhere the people of the sea told him the same things
seals had come to those islands once upon a time
even when he swam thousands of miles out of the pacific and got to a place called cape corrientes
he found a few hundred mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too
he headed round the horn back to his own beaches and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of green trees
kotick caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows
if i am driven to the killingpens with the holluschickie i shall not care
i am the last of the lost rookery of masafuera
i am the only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches
this cheered him immensely and when he came back to novastoshnah that summer
for he was no longer a holluschick but a fullgrown seacatch
it is always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach
there was another seal who thought that she would put off marrying till the next year
kotick danced the firedance with her all down lukannon beach the night before he set off on his last exploration
because he had fallen on the trail of a great shoal of halibut
he needed at least one hundred pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition
then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the hollows of the ground swell that sets in to copper island
turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched
for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds
but a shovellike tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet leather
their heads were the most foolishlooking things you ever saw
they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they weren't grazing
bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front flippers as a fat man waves his arm
the big things answered by bowing and waving their flippers like the frog footman
they tucked the stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly
if you do happen to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn't show off so
the split lips moved and twitched and the glassy green eyes stared
youre the only people ive ever met uglier than sea vitch and with worse manners
then he remembered in a flash what the burgomaster gull had screamed to him when he was a little yearling at walrus islet
for he knew that he had found sea cow at last
the sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed
kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked up in his travels and the sea people talk nearly as many languages as human beings
but the sea cows did not answer because sea cow can not talk
he has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven
they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even to his companions
by waving it up and down and about he makes what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code
by daylight kotick's mane was standing on end and his temper was gone where the dead crabs go
then the sea cow began to travel northward very slowly
stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time
people who are such idiots as these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn't found out some safe island
what is good enough for the sea cow is good enough for the sea catch
the herd never went more than forty or fifty miles a day
kept close to the shore all the time while kotick swam round them
as they went farther north they held a bowing council every few hours
kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were following up a warm current of water
one night they sank through the shiny water sank like stones and for the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly
for he never dreamed that sea cow was anything of a swimmer
they headed for a cliff by the shore a cliff that ran down into deep water
plunged into a dark hole at the foot of it
kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they led him through
the sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of the finest beaches that kotick had ever seen
there were long stretches of smoothworn rock running for miles
there were playgrounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them
the first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good
then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog
ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach
between the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs
somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel
even if there were any men and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters
he began to think of the seal he had left behind him
but though he was in a hurry to go back to novastoshnah
so that he would be able to answer all questions
then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel
no one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being such a place
when he looked back at the cliffs even kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them
though he was not swimming slowly and when he hauled out just above sea lion's neck the first person he met was the seal who had been waiting for him
she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found his island at last
all the other seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered
but you can't come from no one knows where and order us off like this
the young seal began twisting his head from side to side
i only want to show you all a place where you will be safe
for he was very angry at having to fight at all
for kotick's head was out and his teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal's neck
then he threw himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach
then kotick roared to the seals ive done my best for you these five seasons past
but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks you won't believe
he flung himself at the biggest sea catch he could find
choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for mercy
kotick had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year
hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut
upsetting the young bachelors in all directions and sea catch gave a roar and shouted he may be a fool
old sea catch waddled in with his mustache on end
while matkah and the seal that was going to marry kotick cowered down and admired their menfolk
for the two fought as long as there was a seal that dared lift up his head
when there were none they paraded grandly up and down the beach side by side
just as the northern lights were winking and flashing through the fog
kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals
the killer whale himself could not have cut them up worse
ill come with you to your island if there is such a place
there was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the beaches
then kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly
all the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his wounds
a week later he and his army went away north to the sea cow's tunnel
when they all met off the fishing banks of the pacific
kotick's seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond sea cow's tunnel that more and more seals left novastoshnah
they need a long time to turn things over in their minds
but year after year more seals went away from novastoshnah
lukannon this is the great deepsea song that all the st
paul seals sing when they are heading back to their beaches in the summer
it is a sort of very sad seal national anthem
where roaring on the ledges the summer groundswell rolled i heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers song the beaches of lukannon two million voices strong
the song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes
the song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame the beaches of lukannon before the sealers came
they came and went in legions that darkened all the shore
o'er the foamflecked offing as far as voice could reach we hailed the landingparties and we sang them up the beach
the beaches of lukannon the winter wheat so tall the dripping
the beaches of lukannon the home where we were born
men shoot us in the water and club us on the land men drive us to the salt house like silly sheep and tame
tell the deepsea viceroys the story of our woe ere
the beaches of lukannon shall know their sons no more
rikkitikkitavi at the hole where he went in redeye called to wrinkleskin
this is the story of the great war that rikkitikkitavi fought singlehanded
through the bathrooms of the big bungalow in segowlee cantonment
who never comes out into the middle of the floor
rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail
but quite like a weasel in his head and his habits
his eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink
he could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg
he could fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush
his war cry as he scuttled through the long grass was rikktikktikkitikkitchk
a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived with his father and mother
he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path
a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked
it is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose
because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity
the motto of all the mongoose family is run and find out
i suppose he's so tame because weve been kind to him
hell run in and out of the house all day long
when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots
there are more things to find out about in this house
than all my family could find out in all their lives
put his nose into the ink on a writing table
burned it on the end of the big man's cigar
for he climbed up in the big man's lap to see how writing was done
at nightfall he ran into teddy's nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted
because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night
teddy's safer with that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him
if a snake came into the nursery now but teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful
early in the morning rikkitikki came to early breakfast in the veranda riding on teddy's shoulder
he sat on all their laps one after the other
then rikkitikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen
snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thornbush
they had made a beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges with fibers
one of our babies fell out of the nest yesterday and nag ate him
that is very sad but i am a stranger here
darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering
for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss a horrid cold sound that made rikkitikki jump back two clear feet
then inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of nag
when he had lifted onethird of himself clear of the ground
he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind
he looked at rikkitikki with the wicked snake's eyes that never change their expression
the great god brahm put his mark upon all our people
when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off brahm as he slept
rikkitikki saw the spectaclemark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part of a hookandeye fastening
but it is impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time
he knew that all a grown mongoose's business in life was to fight and eat snakes
do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a nest
watching the least little movement in the grass behind rikkitikki
he knew that mongooses in the garden meant death sooner or later for him and his family
he jumped up in the air as high as he could go
she had crept up behind him as he was talking
lashing up as high as he could reach toward the nest in the thornbush
but darzee had built it out of reach of snakes
he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo
it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do next
for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once
so he trotted off to the gravel path near the house
you will find they say that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten
he runs off and eats some herb that cures him
this makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb
it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to escape a blow from behind
the dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth and his bite is as dangerous as the cobra's
but he is so small that nobody thinks of him
but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly off from it at any angle you please
he was doing a much more dangerous thing than fighting nag
that unless rikki bit him close to the back of the head
he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip
but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his shoulder
bitten as high up the back as he could get hold
rikkitikki was just going to eat him up from the tail
when he remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose
he went away for a dust bath under the castoroil bushes
i have settled it all and then teddy's mother picked him up from the dust and hugged him
teddy's mother might just as well have petted teddy for playing in the dust
walking to and fro among the wineglasses on the table
he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things
though it was very pleasant to be patted and petted by teddy's mother
he would go off into his long war cry of rikktikktikkitikkitchk
but as soon as teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house
trying to make up his mind to run into the middle of the room
how am i to be sure that nag won't mistake me for you some dark night
chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers
i never had spirit enough to run out into the middle of the room
at the bottom of the smooth plaster wall there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water
as rikkitikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put
he heard nag and nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight
remember that the big man who killed karait is the first one to bite
but are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the people
we are king and queen of the garden and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melon bed hatch
but there is no need that we should hunt for rikkitikki afterward
rikkitikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this
rikkitikki was very frightened as he saw the size of the big cobra
nagaina will know and if i fight him on the open floor
then rikkitikki heard him drinking from the biggest waterjar that was used to fill the bath
but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he will not have a stick
round the bulge at the bottom of the water jar
wondering which would be the best place for a good hold
if i don't break his back at the first jump
he looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood
but that was too much for him and a bite near the tail would only make nag savage
it must be the head he said at last the head above the hood
the head was lying a little clear of the water jar
rikki braced his back against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head
then he was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog to and fro on the floor
but his eyes were red and he held on as the body cartwhipped over the floor
upsetting the tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush
as he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter
for he made sure he would be banged to death
felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him
a hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur
had fired both barrels of a shotgun into nag just behind the hood
then teddy's mother came in with a very white face
rikkitikki dragged himself to teddy's bedroom and spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out whether he really was broken into forty pieces
there's no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch
rikkitikki ran to the thornbush where darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice
the news of nag's death was all over the garden
for the sweeper had thrown the body on the rubbishheap
the valiant rikkitikki caught him by the head and held fast
nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for nag
nag came out on the end of a stick the sweeper picked him up on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap
you don't know when to do the right thing at the right time
if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken
darzee was a featherbrained little fellow who could never hold more than one idea at a time in his head
just because he knew that nagaina's children were born in eggs like his own
he didn't think at first that it was fair to kill them
she knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on
she fluttered in front of nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out
the boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it
it may be some consolation to you when youre dead to know that i shall settle accounts with the boy
but before night the boy in the house will lie very still
for a bird who looks at a snake's eyes gets so frightened that she can not move
rikkitikki heard them going up the path from the stables
he raced for the end of the melon patch near the wall
for he could see the baby cobras curled up inside the skin
he knew that the minute they were hatched they could each kill a man or a mongoose
he bit off the tops of the eggs as fast as he could
turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed any
tumbled backward down the melonbed with the third egg in his mouth
scuttled to the veranda as hard as he could put foot to the ground
teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast
nagaina was coiled up on the matting by teddy's chair
rikkitikki put his paws one on each side of the egg
the ants are eating all the others down by the melon bed
it was i i i that caught nag by the hood last night in the bathroom
he was dead before the big man blew him in two
nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing teddy
for you will go to the rubbish heap with nag
each time her head came with a whack on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a watch spring
then rikkitikki danced in a circle to get behind her
nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head
so that the rustle of her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind
she goes like a whiplash flicked across a horse's neck
she headed straight for the long grass by the thornbush
as he was running rikkitikki heard darzee still singing his foolish little song of triumph
as she plunged into the rathole where she and nag used to live
it was dark in the hole and rikkitikki never knew when it might open out and give nagaina room to turn and strike at him
stuck out his feet to act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot
then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving
so he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the minute
rikkitikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed
the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him
began to troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth
rikkitikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was slept and slept till it was late in the afternoon
tells all the news to everybody who cares to listen
he heard his attention notes like a tiny dinner gong
for nag and nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little birds
teddy and teddy's mother and teddy's father came out and almost cried over him and that night he ate all that was given him till he could eat no more
where teddy's mother saw him when she came to look late at night
he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it
till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls
darzee's chant singer and tailor am i doubled the joys that i know proud of my lilt to the sky
proud of the house that i sew over and under
so weave i my music so weave i the house that i sew
terror that hid in the roses is impotent flung on the dunghill and dead
i will sing you the praise of the bottletailed rikki
toomai of the elephants i will remember what i was
i am sick of rope and chain i will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs
i will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugarcane i will go out to my own kind
until the morning break out to the wind's untainted kiss
the water's clean caress i will forget my anklering and snap my picket stake
had served the indian government in every way that an elephant could serve it for fortyseven years
as he was fully twenty years old when he was caught
that makes him nearly seventy a ripe age for an elephant
who had been caught in the same drive with kala nag
for the first time that he saw a shell burst he backed
so he was the bestloved and the bestlookedafter elephant in the service of the government of india
he had been hoisted into a ship at the end of a steam crane and taken for days across the water
made to carry a mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from india
he had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called ali musjid
ten years later and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at moulmein
there he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work
with a few score other elephants who were trained to the business
in helping to catch wild elephants among the garo hills
there is one whole department which does nothing else but hunt them
send them up and down the country as they are needed for work
his tusks had been cut off short at five feet
with bands of copper but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones
after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across the hills
the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last stockade
picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob
would hammer him and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other elephants roped and tied the smaller ones
there was nothing in the way of fighting that kala nag
for he had stood up more than once in his time to the charge of the wounded tiger
curling up his soft trunk to be out of harm's way
had knocked the springing brute sideways in midair with a quick sickle cut of his head
that he had invented all by himself had knocked him over
kneeled upon him with his huge knees till the life went out with a gasp and a howl
there was only a fluffy striped thing on the ground for kala nag to pull by the tail
the son of black toomai who had taken him to abyssinia
grandson of toomai of the elephants who had seen him caught
there is nothing that the black snake fears except me
he has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him
he would take his father's place on kala nag's neck when he grew up
he knew what he was talking of for he had been born under kala nag's shadow
had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk
had taken him down to water as soon as he could walk
told him to salute his master that was to be
made him lift up his feet one after the other
then thou wilt have nothing to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears
walk at the head of the processions of the king
but not so good as this hunting in the jungles
this running up and down among the hills is not the best government service
with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve
the long hours when there was nothing to do except to watch kala nag fidgeting in his pickets
when all the hills and valleys smoked the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night the steady
the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night's drive
when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a landslide
flung themselves at the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and volleys of blank cartridge
but the really good time came when the driving out began
the stockade looked like a picture of the end of the world
then little toomai would climb up to the top of one of the quivering stockade posts
his sunbleached brown hair flying loose all over his shoulders
as soon as there was a lull you could hear his highpitched yells of encouragement to kala nag
the big fight between kala nag and the wild elephant would sway to and fro across the keddah
the old elephant catchers would wipe the sweat out of their eyes
find time to nod to little toomai wriggling with joy on the top of the posts
one night he slid down from the post and slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope
to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on the leg of a kicking young calf
are not good brick elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough
that thou must needs go elephant catching on thy own account
but petersen sahib was the greatest white man in the world to him
he was the head of all the keddah operations the man who caught all the elephants for the government of india
who knew more about the ways of elephants than any living man
he may even require thee to be an elephant catcher
at last to be trampled to death in the keddah
we of the plains are sent back to our stations
i am angry that thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty assamese jungle folk
a man who gets a pension at the end of his service
is the family of toomai of the elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of a keddah
go and wash kala nag and attend to his ears
or else petersen sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter a follower of elephant's foot tracks
but he told kala nag all his grievances while he was examining his feet
turning up the fringe of kala nag's huge right ear
that is a big thorn that i have pulled out
the next few days were spent in getting the elephants together
in walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains
in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or lost in the forest
petersen sahib came in on his clever sheelephant pudmini he had been paying off other camps among the hills
there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree
as each man was paid he went back to his elephant
who stayed in the jungle year in and year out
sat on the backs of the elephants that belonged to petersen sahib's permanent force
or leaned against the trees with their guns across their arms
laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and ran about
big toomai went up to the clerk with little toomai behind him
there goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least
't is a pity to send that young junglecock to molt in the plains
as a man must have who listens to the most silent of all living things the wild elephant
he turned where he was lying all along on pudmini's back and said
i did not know of a man among the plainsdrivers who had wit enough to rope even a dead elephant
when we were trying to get that young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother
the elephant caught him up in his trunk and held him level with pudmini's forehead
he was just as bashful as a child could be
was it to help thee steal green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry
all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter
most of them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys
little toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air
he wished very much that he were eight feet underground
a boy who can face a full keddah at his age does not end in jails
here are four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under that great thatch of hair
that keddahs are not good for children to play in
come to me when thou hast seen the elephants dance
then i will let thee go into all the keddahs
there are great cleared flat places hidden away in the forests that are called elephants ballrooms
when a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other drivers say
he bowed to the earth again and went away with his father
squealing elephants rolled down the hill path to the plains
it was a very lively march on account of the new elephants
so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commanderinchief
that thou shouldst never be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers
why should petersen sahib have chosen me to go down with you donkeys of the rice fields
or else they can smell their companions in the jungle
kala nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the wind out of him
we have swept the hills of wild elephants at the last catch
anyone but a mudhead who never saw the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the season
therefore all the wild elephants tonight will but why should i waste wisdom on a riverturtle
who has swept all the hills of all the elephants
yes but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls of his hut
they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new elephants
but they lost their tempers long before they got there
then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps of pickets
the hill drivers went back to petersen sahib through the afternoon light
telling the plains drivers to be extra careful that night
he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion
he sits down to a sort of revel all by himself
but the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tomtom a drum beaten with the flat of the hand and he sat down
before kala nag as the stars began to come out
the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him
he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his small brother to sleep with an old
who once told all the animals what they should eat
who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow
sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago
from the king upon the guddee to the beggar at the gate
little toomai came in with a joyous tunkatunk at the end of each verse
till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at kala nag's side
at last the elephants began to lie down one after another as is their custom
till only kala nag at the right of the line was left standing up and he rocked slowly from side to side
his ears put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the hills
the air was full of all the night noises that
make one big silence the click of one bamboo stem against the other
kala nag was still standing up with his ears cocked
watched the curve of his big back against half the stars in heaven
so far away that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness
all the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot
they came out and drove in the picket pegs with big mallets
tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet
big toomai took off kala nag's leg chain and shackled that elephant forefoot to hindfoot
but slipped a loop of grass string round kala nag's leg
he knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before
kala nag did not answer to the order by gurgling
his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans
tend to him if he grows restless in the night
when he heard the coir string snap with a little tang
kala nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley
took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight
there was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines
sometimes a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides of a ship
sometimes a cluster of wildpepper vines would scrape along his back
or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it
but between those times he moved absolutely without any sound
drifting through the thick garo forest as though it had been smoke
but though little toomai watched the stars in the rifts of the trees
then kala nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute
little toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and furry under the moonlight for miles and miles
he felt that the forest was awake below him awake and alive and crowded
kala nag began to go down into the valley not quietly this time
but as a runaway gun goes down a steep bank in one rush
the undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a noise like torn canvas
the saplings that he heaved away right and left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank
hung from his tusks as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway
then little toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging bough should sweep him to the ground
he wished that he were back in the lines again
kala nag's feet sucked and squelched as he put them down
the night mist at the bottom of the valley chilled little toomai
little toomai could hear more splashing and some trumpeting both upstream and down great grunts and angry snortings
all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling
where the bent junglegrass was trying to recover itself and stand up
many elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before
behind him a great wild tusker with his little pig's eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the misty river
the sound of breaking branches on every side of them
at last kala nag stood still between two treetrunks at the very top of the hill
they were part of a circle of trees that grew round an irregular space of some three or four acres
the ground had been trampled down as hard as a brick floor
the white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight
but within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of green nothing but the trampled earth
more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks
he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens
outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the hillside
but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts
with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears fat
little pinky black calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs young elephants with their tusks just beginning to show
scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights
the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their shoulders and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the fullstroke
or walking to and fro across the ground in couples
or rocking and swaying all by themselves scores and scores of elephants
toomai knew that so long as he lay still on kala nag's neck nothing would happen to him
once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a leg iron in the forest
she must have broken her pickets and come straight from petersen sahib's camp and little toomai saw another elephant
must have run away from some camp in the hills about
at last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest
kala nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of the crowd
all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue
little toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs
he heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident
the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd
steady hustling and pushing and gurgling went on just the same
he knew that there were elephants all round kala nag
that there was no chance of backing him out of the assembly so he set his teeth and shivered
in a keddah at least there was torchlight and shouting
once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee
they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds
the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs
kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other
it sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave
the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall
little toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound
but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth
once or twice he could feel kala nag and all the others surge forward a few strides
the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised
but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again
he could not tell where he was in the clearing
but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn was coming
the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills
before little toomai had got the ringing out of his head
there was not an elephant in sight except kala nag
there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to show where the others had gone
but the undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back
the elephants had stamped out more room had stamped the thick grass and juicy cane to trash
let us keep by pudmini and go to petersen sahib's camp
he may have belonged to some little native king's establishment
his hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew
in two hours he was lying very contentedly in petersen sahib's hammock with petersen sahib's shootingcoat under his head
scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him
they will find that the elephant folk have trampled down more room in their danceroom
little toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into the twilight
while he slept petersen sahib and machua appa followed the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills
machua appa had no need to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there
for the ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man
but never have i heard that any child of man had seen what this child has seen
when they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal
but he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep and some fowls
as well as a double ration of flour and rice and salt
big toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for his son and his elephant
now that he had found them he looked at them as though he were afraid of them both
there was a feast by the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants
the men who know all the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants
they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed junglecock
the red light of the logs made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too
the head of all the drivers of all the keddahs machua appa
who had never seen a made road in forty years machua appa
who was so great that he had no other name than machua appa
with little toomai held high in the air above his head
this little one shall no more be called little toomai
what never man has seen he has seen through the long night
the favor of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungles is with him
the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him
he whirled up the line of pickets here is the little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places
at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the tips touched their foreheads
broke out into the full salute the crashing trumpetpeal that only the viceroy of india hears
but it was all for the sake of little toomai
who had seen what never man had seen before the dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills
broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door battle to the tiger
rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night
none he saw too low parbati beside him watched them come and go thought to cheat her husband
turning shiv to jest stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast
saw the least of little things gnawed a newgrown leaf
her majesty's servants you can work it out by fractions or by simple rule of three
but the way of tweedledum is not the way of tweedledee
but the way of pilly winky's not the way of winkie pop
it had been raining heavily for one whole month raining on a camp of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels
mules all gathered together at a place called rawal pindi
he was receiving a visit from the amir of afghanistan a wild king of a very wild country
every night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark
or the camels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents
you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep
but one night a man popped his head in and shouted
so i put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out into the slush
went out through the other side and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling
because i did not know how many camels might have got loose
before long i was out of sight of the camp
at last i fell over the tailend of a gun
by that knew i was somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at night
as i did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark
i put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun
made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that i found
just as i was getting ready to go to sleep i heard a jingle of harness and a grunt
for i could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad
the screwguns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces
that are screwed together when the time comes to use them
with his big soft feet squelching and slipping in the mud
his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen's
of course from the natives to know what he was saying
he must have been the one that flopped into my tent
it took a stick and hit me on the neck
but i may as well give you something on account now
i heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum
youll know better than to run through a mule battery at night
there was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness
a big troophorse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade
those camels have racketed through our lines again the third time this week
how's a horse to keep his condition if he isn't allowed to sleep
im the breechpiece mule of number two gun of the first screw battery
i walked out of my lines to get a little peace and quiet here
i am only a baggage camel of the 39th native infantry
then why didn't you stay and carry baggage for the 39th native infantry
you and your friends have waked the camp very thoroughly
it takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gunbullock
a yoke of the great sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won't go any nearer to the firing
the gunbullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud
ive a very great mind to give you a numberone kicking
the idea of a fourteenhand mule with your training disgracing the battery before this gentleman
the first time i ever saw a man i ran for half a day
nearly all our horses for the english cavalry are brought to india from australia
the first time they put the full harness with all its chains on my back i stood on my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off
but the battery said they had never seen anything like it
they fell up and down the lines and bubbled and my headrope broke
as soon as i heard the camels were loose i came away on my own account
answered both together the seventh yoke of the first gun of the big gun battery
but when we were trampled on we got up and walked away
it is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good bedding
we told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid of
i heard him say something about not being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world
but the bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on chewing
anybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night
just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our headropes
when i haven't been out for a day or two
all i have to do is to watch where i am putting my feet
do you mean to say that you aren't taught to be bridlewise in your business
unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck
get round with your hind legs under you the instant you feel the rein on your neck
rear up a little and come round on your hind legs
were taught to obey the man at our head step off when he says so
generally i have to go in among a lot of yelling
worse than the farrier's knives and i have to take care that dick's boot is just touching the next man's boot without crushing it
i can see dick's lance to the right of my right eye
i shouldn't care to be the man or horse that stood up to dick and me when were in a hurry
but that wasn't dick's fault a lot i should have cared whose fault it was
next time i have to go over a man lying down i shall step on him hard
the proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a wellbalanced saddle
hang on by all four feet and your ears too
till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge where there's just room enough for your hoofs
then you stand still and keep quiet never ask a man to hold your head
young un keep quiet while the guns are being put together
then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the treetops ever so far below
they say that when a mule trips you can split a hen's ear
now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule
it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at
the science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line
even if you have to go a mile out of your way
i lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing
fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing
you know that as soon as the guns are in position theyll do all the charging
the baggagecamel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time past
but not in that climbing way or that running way
you don't look as though you were made for climbing or running much
they teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across us
but dick cunliffe is the only man id trust to do that
there are plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by
you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night
my heels and his head would have something to say to each other
then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his big head and said
to put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon as two tails trumpets
to show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other side
then we tug the big gun all together heya hullah
we do not climb like cats nor run like calves
we graze while the big guns talk across the plain to some town with mud walls
the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home
we eat till we are yoked up again and tug the gun back to where two tails is waiting for it
sometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back
then there is all the more grazing for those that are left
do you gentlemen of the screwgun battery feel inclined to eat when you are being fired at with big guns
about as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all over us
a driver you can trust to let you pick your own way
for every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey
he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every horse he came across
imagine the feelings of sunol if a carhorse called her a skate
i saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark
id have you know that im related on my mother's side to carbine
where i come from we aren't accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrotmouthed
for neither horse nor mule can bear to listen to an elephant's voice
why are you afraid of the guns when they fire
i know you are a good deal braver than you think you are
my battery captain called me a pachydermatous anachronism the other day
i can see inside my head what will happen when a shell bursts
i know there's a great deal of me to take care of
i know that nobody knows how to cure me when im sick
all they can do is to stop my driver's pay till i get well
you could put a whole regiment of dicks on my back without making me feel any better
it is red stuff that soaks into the ground and smells
the troophorse gave a kick and a bound and a snort
it makes me want to run when i haven't dick on my back
two tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled
you wouldn't be needed to pull the big guns at all
if i was like my captain he can see things inside his head before the firing begins
but he knows too much to run away if i was like him i could pull the guns
but if i were as wise as all that i should never be here
but giving a thing a long name doesn't make it any better
now you just explain to me why you don't like this
he began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet
she knew as well as i did that if there is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog
so she stopped to bully two tails in his pickets
that our friend two tails is afraid of most things
if i had a full meal for every dog ive kicked across the paradeground i should be as fat as two tails nearly
told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp
i never let her know that i understood beast talk
so i buttoned her into the breast of my overcoat
but it made me feel as though i had hornets where my saddle ought to be
the camel here is frightened by bad dreams in the night
it is very lucky for us that we haven't all got to fight in the same way
who had been quiet for a long time what i want to know is
the man who walks at your head or sits on your back or holds the nose rope or twists your tail
said billy and the troophorse and the camel and the bullocks one after the other
all you have to do is to obey the man at your head and ask no questions
obey the man next to you who gives the order
it is true that we only see out of our eyes
we are the only people tonight who have not been afraid
do you suppose im looked after by a black bullockdriver
managed somehow to run their yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon
the bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that indian cattle give
pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in the mud
i never knew before what made indian cattle so scared of englishmen
we eat beef a thing that no cattledriver touches and of course the cattle do not like it
whod have thought of two big lumps like those losing their heads
white men who haven't a place to sleep in are more than likely to be thieves
ive a good deal of government property on my back
billy the mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old campaigner
told him fibs about the scores of horses that she and i kept
hell have two hours hard work dressing me for parade
the big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon
vixen and i had a good place close to the viceroy and the amir of afghanistan
big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the center
the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving together
vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dogcart
i saw two tails and two other elephants harnessed in line to a fortypounder siege gun
billy the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops
i gave a cheer all by myself for billy the mule
for a while it was too misty to see what the troops were doing
they had made a big half circle across the plain
that line grew and grew and grew till it was threequarters of a mile long from wing to wing one solid wall of men
then it came on straight toward the viceroy and the amir
like the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast
unless you have been there you can not imagine what a frightening effect this steady comedown of troops has on the spectators
up till then he had not shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else
but now his eyes began to get bigger and bigger
he picked up the reins on his horse's neck and looked behind him
the regiments went off to their camps in the rain
an infantry band struck up with the animals went in two by two
they all got into the ark for to get out of the rain
your amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our viceroy
parade song of the camp animals elephants of the gun teams we lent to alexander the strength of hercules
the cunning of our knees we bowed our necks to service they ne'er were loosed again
make way there way for the tenfoot teams of the fortypounder train
gun bullocks those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannonball
it's sweeter than stables or water to me the cavalry canter of bonnie dundee
then feed us and break us and handle and groom
launch us in column of squadron and see the way of the warhorse to bonnie dundee
screwgun mules as me and my companions were scrambling up a hill
but we went forward still for we can wriggle and climb
that lets us pick our road bad luck to all the drivermen that can not pack a load for we can wriggle and climb
commissariat camels we haven't a camelty tune of our own to help us trollop along
somebody's load has tipped off in the road cheer for a halt and a row
all the beasts together children of the camp are we
serving each in his degree children of the yoke and goad
can not tell why we or they march and suffer day by day
i jimmy skunk is puzzled old mother west wind had just come down from the purple hills and turned loose her children
from the big bag in which she had been carrying them
they were very lively and very merry as they danced and raced across the green meadows in all directions
for it was good to be back there once more
old mother west wind almost sighed as she watched them for a few minutes
she had to turn the windmill to pump water for farmer brown's cows
this was only one of many mills standing idle as they waited for her
so she puffed her cheeks out and started about her business
jimmy skunk sat at the top of the hill that overlooks the green meadows and watched her out of sight
then he started to amble down the lone little path to look for some beetles
when he heard some one puffing and blowing behind him
he was greatly surprised when he discovered old mister toad
but he was hopping along in the most determined way as if he were in a great hurry to get somewhere
now it is a very unusual thing for mister toad to hurry
as a rule he hops a few steps and then sits down to think it over
jimmy had never before seen him hop more than a few steps unless he was trying to get away from danger
of course the first thing jimmy thought of was mister blacksnake
but there was no sign of mister blacksnake nor of any other danger
he saw right away that old mister toad didn't seem to be frightened at all
whatever has got into those long hind legs of yours to make them work so fast
but simply tried to get past jimmy and keep on his way
jimmy put out one hand and turned old mister toad right over on his back
where he kicked and struggled in an effort to get on his feet again
don't you know that it isn't polite not to speak when you are spoken to
but don't you know that it isn't good for the health to hurry so
exclaimed jimmy as if he could hardly believe his ears
i have a very important part in the spring chorus
he just lay down and rolled over and over with laughter
as mister toad thinking that he had a beautiful voice
when at last he stopped because he couldn't laugh any more
he discovered that old mister toad was on his way again
ii jimmy skunk consults his friends jimmy skunk scratched his head thoughtfully as he watched old mister toad go down the lone little path
if old mister toad had told him that he could fly
or found it harder to believe than that old mister toad had a beautiful voice
he thought that old mister toad was trying to fool him
when he forgets to do that you may make up your mind that jimmy is doing some hard thinking
what have you got on your mind this fine morning
did you ever see him hurry unless he was frightened
that he has to take part in the spring chorus at the smiling pool and that he is late
peter looked very hard at jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the truth
yet he was just as earnest about it as if it were really so
i think he must have eaten something that has gone to his head
jimmy told the story about old mister toad all over again
unc billy chuckled and laughed just as they had at the idea of old mister toad's saying he had a beautiful voice
but unc billy has a shrewd little head on his shoulders
ah done learn a right smart long time ago that ah don know all there is to know about mah neighbors
weuns done think of brer toad as uglylookin fo so long that weuns may have overlooked something
what do youalls say to weuns going down to the smiling pool and finding out what he really is up to
you know peter is always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity
then he decided that as he hadn't anything in particular to do
as he might find some fat beetles on the way
taking his time and keeping a sharp eye out for fat beetles
though old mister toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was quite out of breath
he wasn't getting along very fast compared with the way peter rabbit or jimmy skunk or unc billy possum could cover the ground
you see he can not make long jumps like his cousin
so peter and jimmy and unc billy took their time about following him
they stopped to hunt for fat beetles for jimmy skunk
at every little patch of sweet clover for peter rabbit to help himself
once they wasted a lot of time while unc billy possum hunted for a nest of carol the meadow lark
on the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there
he didn't find the nest for the very good reason that carol hadn't built one yet
he is always sorry for his feathered friends when their eggs are stolen
half way across the green meadows they stopped to play with the merry little breezes
you see all the time he had kept right on going
but even a slowpoke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any time always gets somewhere sooner or later
so it happened that when at last peter and jimmy and unc billy reached the smiling pool
ah reckons weuns will find him sittin on the bank here somewhere
so right away the three separated to look for old mister toad
all along the bank of the smiling pool they looked
they looked in every place where old mister toad might have hidden
peter explained how they had followed old mister toad just to see what he really was up to
of course we know that he hasn't any more voice than i have
but we are curious to know if he really thinks he has
why he should be in such a hurry to reach the smiling pool
it looks to us as if the spring has made old mister toad crazy
im ever so glad to learn that he hasn't forgotten that he has a very important part in our beautiful spring chorus
toad it isn't often that peter rabbit is truly envious
he envies the birds because they can pour out in beautiful song the joy that is in them
the only way he can express his feelings is by kicking his long heels
it doesn't add to the joy of other people as do the songs of the birds
you know to give joy to others is to add to your own joy
so there are times when peter wishes he could sing
as he sat on the bank of the smiling pool
there's joy in the spring for you and for me
from over in the green meadows rose the clear lilt of carol the meadow lark
among the alders just where the laughing brook ran into the smiling pool a flood of happiness was pouring from the throat of little friend the song sparrow
so that it was hard to say just where it did come from
welcome robin was singing as if his heart were bursting with joy
for a mighty chorus of clear piping voices from unseen singers rose from all around its banks
although look as he would he could see none of them
peter forgot for a time what had brought him to the smiling pool
stealing up behind peter and poking him in the back
i was just listening and wishing that i could sing
i never waste time wishing i could do things it was never meant i should do
he said that he was coming down here to sing
ive looked everywhere i can think of without finding him
but i don't believe in giving up without another try
so peter stopped his dreaming and joined in the search
now there was one place where neither peter nor jimmy nor unc billy had thought of looking
they just took it for granted that old mister toad was somewhere on the bank
presently peter came to a place where the bank was very low and the water was shallow for quite a little distance out in the smiling pool
from out of that shallow water came the piping voice of a hyla
suddenly he jumped right up in the air with surprise
there was a familiarlooking head sticking out of the water
toads music bag never think that you have learned all there is to know
he's sitting right over there where the water is shallow
then creep over to the edge of the smiling pool and watch to see if old mister toad really does try to sing
the three stole very softly over to the edge of the smiling pool
there sat old mister toad with just his head out of water
his big eyes looking as if they might pop out of his head
pears to me that that song is coming right from where brer toad is sitting
of all the songs that glad spring day there was none sweeter
the only trouble was the song was so very short
old mister toad looked quite his natural self again just as commonplace
until it was no wonder that jimmy skunk had thought that he was in danger of blowing up
so sweet and tremulous that peter actually held his breath to listen
there was no doubt that old mister toad was singing just as he had said he was going to
it was just as true that his song was one of the sweetest if not the sweetest of all the chorus from and around the smiling pool
but peter and jimmy and unc billy both saw and heard
their respect for old mister toad grew tremendously as they listened
don't you see it's only when that is swelled out that he sings
i didn't know he had any such bag there at all
that i had a music bag like that in my throat
then he joined in the laugh of jimmy and unc billy
but still with something of a look of wistfulness in his eyes
vi peter discovers something more there are stranger things in the world today than ever you dreamed could be
there's beauty in some of the commonest things if only youve eyes to see
ever since peter rabbit was a little chap and had first ran away from home
he knew that most of his neighbors thought the same way
for he was always goodnatured and attended strictly to his own affairs but they liked to poke fun at him
now that they had discovered that he really has a very beautiful voice
they began to look on him with a great deal more respect
he got in the habit of going over to the smiling pool every day
just to sit on the bank and listen to old mister toad
why didn't you ever tell us before that you could sing
as old mister toad looked up at him from the smiling pool
youve sat on that very bank lots of times while i was singing
is that you don't use your eyes or your ears
it wouldn't be peter to let a chance for questions go by
have i ever heard you singing up on the meadows or in the old orchard
all my family gathers here in the spring to sing
old mister toad filled out his queer music bag under his chin and began to sing again
now it just happened that old mister toad was facing him
for it came over him that those eyes were very beautiful
there is an old saying that every toad has jewels in his head
old mister toad once more swelled out his throat and began to sing
never again will i call anybody homely and ugly until i know all about him
vii a shadow passes over the smiling pool here's what mister toad says heed it well
my dear time to watch for clouds is when the sky is clear
he says that that is the reason that he lives to a good old age
i suppose he means that when the sky is cloudy
everybody is looking for rain and is prepared for it
most people forget that there is such a thing as a storm
so when it comes suddenly very few are prepared for it
so old mister toad very wisely watches out when there seems to be the least need of it
over back of the purple hills to which old mother west wind had taken her children
but over the green meadows and the smiling pool the shadows had drawn a curtain of soft dusk which in the green forest became black
the little stars looked down from the sky and twinkled just to see their reflections twinkle back at them from the smiling pool
making little silver lines on the surface of the smiling pool and squeaking contentedly
all the feathered songsters who had made joyous the bright day had gone to bed
but this did not mean that the glad spring chorus was silent
were pouring out their gladness as if they had not been singing most of the departed day
you see it was the hour they love best of all
the hour which seems to them just made for singing
they were doing their best to tell old mother nature how they love her
how glad they were that she had brought back sweet mistress spring to waken them from their long sleep
it was so peaceful and beautiful there that it didn't seem possible that danger of any kind could be lurking near
swelling out that queer music bag in his throat and singing with all his might
in a minute there wasn't a sound from the smiling pool save the squeak of jerry muskrat hidden among the bulrushes
that great chorus stopped as abruptly as the electric lights go out when you press a button
but there was no sign of any living thing in the smiling pool
after awhile the shadow floated away over the green meadows without a sound
hooty the owl didn't get one of us that time
said old mister toad to his nearest neighbor with a chuckle of satisfaction
then he swelled out his music bag and began to sing again
for nothing had happened to bring sadness as might have but for the watchfulness of old mister toad
toads babies the smiling pool's a nursery where all the sunny day a thousand funny babies are taught while at their play
so do jerry muskrat's babies and those of billy mink
there you will find the children and grandchildren of grandfather frog and old mister toad
peter rabbit had known for a long time about the frog babies
but though he knew that old mister toad was own cousin to grandfather frog
except that at a certain time in the year he was forever running across tiny toads
peter had heard it said that toads rain down from the sky
right away there would be so many tiny toads that it was hard work to jump without stepping on some
he remembered this as he went to pay his daily call on old mister toad in the smiling pool and listen to his sweet song
but he remembered his experiences with them in other years
he was too much interested in what he was watching
peter stared down into the water to see what was interesting old mister toad so much
but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggling tadpoles
there was a look of great pride in his face
but he couldn't see anything that looked like a baby toad
i don't see any babies but those of grandfather frog
i always did think tadpoles about the homeliest things in th world
ill have you know that they are the most beautiful babies in th world
peter drew a hand across his mouth to hide a smile
how any one can mistake my babies for their cousins i can not understand
your babies are no more to be compared with my babies for real beauty than nothing at all
because he had found out that some of them were toads and some were frogs
he hadn't known before that baby toads begin life as tadpoles
but he had no intention of being drawn into the dispute now waxing furious between grandfather frog and old mister toad
grow a little too that's what every pollywoggy tries his best to do
but since he had discovered how proud of them were grandfather frog and old mister toad
he had begun to wonder about them and then to watch them
that is they are not in danger the way any babies are
talking to himself as is his way when there is no one else to talk to
just then a funny little black pollywog wriggled into sight
a stoutjawed waterbeetle suddenly rushed from among the water grass
could it be that that uglylooking bug was as dangerous an enemy to the baby toad as reddy fox is to a baby rabbit
for there was that same little pollywog trying hard to swim and making bad work of it
presently he discovered that pollywogs have to keep their eyes open quite as much as do baby rabbits
longlegs the blue heron seemed to have a special liking for them
they seemed to peter to spend all their time swimming and eating and growing
they grew so fast that it seemed to him that he could almost see them grow
just imagine how surprised peter was to discover one day that that very pollywog which he had seen lose his tail had grown a new one
that puzzled peter more than anything he had seen in a long time
youll see queerer things than that if you watch those pollywogs long enough
very interesting to watch if youve got the time for it
never saw anything like the way those toad youngsters grow
those toad pollywogs you see now will turn into real toads
look at that little fellow over there he's begun to grow legs already
sure enough there was a pollywog with a pair of legs sprouting out
only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs
it had been some time since peter rabbit had visited the smiling pool to watch the pollywogs
but one cloudy morning he happened to think of them
decided that he would run over there and see how they were getting along
he wondered if those pollywog children of old mister toad would be much changed
the last time he saw them some of them had just begun to grow legs
he had almost reached the smiling pool when great big drops of rain began to splash down
only so tiny that one could have sat comfortably on a tencent piece and still had plenty of room
peter's big eyes grew round with surprise as he stared
as if each raindrop turned into a tiny toad the instant it struck the ground
all those little toads were bravely hopping along as if they were bound for some particular place
on the very bank whom should he meet but old mister toad
he was hopping away from the smiling pool where he had been all the spring
peter was almost as surprised to see him as he had been to see the little toads
but just then he was most interested in those little toads
can you tell me where all these little toads came from
lsb illustration can you tell me where all these little toads came from
it it almost seemed as if they had rained down out of the sky
they know that wet weather is the only weather for toads to travel in
they left the smiling pool in the night while it was damp and comfortable
they knew it was good traveling weather and out they popped
i did the same thing myself when i was their age
couldn't stop me any more than i could stop them
toads queer tongue old mother nature doth provide for all her children
her wisdom foresees all their needs and makes provision for them all
how such a slowmoving fellow as he is can catch enough bugs and insects to keep him alive
peter and old mister toad sat in the rain watching the tiny toads
leaving their kindergarten in the smiling pool and starting out to see the great world
didn't have time to eat much while i was in the smiling pool
i begin to realize that ive got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice
sure enough there was a fat bug crawling along on an old leaf
he was sitting exactly where he had been sitting all the time
looking at old mister toad as if he suspected him of joking
he hopped towards a fly which had lighted on a blade of grass just ahead
i wish you would tell me how you do it
now you watch my mouth instead of the ant and see what happens
then he kept his eyes on old mister toad's mouth
suddenly there was a little flash of red from it
so tiny and so quick that peter couldn't be absolutely sure that he saw it
that youve got a tongue long enough to reach way over to where that ant was
where do you keep it when it isn't in use
i should think youd have to swallow it to get it out of the way
is not considered nice to do but if it were like mister toad's id want to show it wouldn't you
it would be such a wonderful tongue that i suspect you would want everybody to see it
old mister toad thinks his tongue the most satisfactory tongue in the world
he is quite sure that without it he couldn't get along at all
yet very few of his neighbors know anything about that tongue and how different it is from most other tongues
what peter couldn't understand was what old mister toad did with a tongue that would reach two inches beyond his mouth
he opened his big mouth and slowly ran his tongue out its full length
but mine and all other tongues that i ever have seen are fastened way down in the throat
there are a great many things you have never heard of
because it is fastened way up in the front of my mouth that way
when i draw it in with a bug on the end of it
peter thought this over for a few minutes before he ventured another question
but how do you hold on to the bug with your tongue
id better be getting back to the dear old briarpatch
ive simply got the things i need in order to live
i couldn't get along with your kind of a tongue
you will learn that old mother nature makes no mistakes
xiii peter rabbit is impolite peter rabbit couldn't get old mister toad off his mind
he had discovered so many interesting things about old mister toad that he was almost on the point of believing him to be the most interesting of all his neighbors
his respect for old mister toad had become very great indeed
who wouldn't respect any one with such beautiful eyes and such a sweet voice and such a wonderful tongue
yet at the same time peter felt very foolish whenever he remembered that all his life he had been acquainted with old mister toad without really knowing him at all
that was that most of his neighbors were just as ignorant regarding old mister toad as peter had been
how we can live right beside people all our lives and not really know them at all
i suppose that is why we should never judge people hastily
i believe i will go hunt up old mister toad and see if i can find out anything more
now that old mister toad had left the smiling pool
but he had an idea that he would not be far from their meeting place of the day before
when old mister toad had explained about his wonderful tongue
that is just the kind of weather that a toad likes best for traveling
thinking of nothing in particular but how good it was to be alive
he had just done this when his ears caught the sound of a queer noise a little to one side of the crooked little path
it seemed to come from under an old piece of board
all he could see was that there was something moving
of course that meant that he had nothing to fear
he saw that old mister toad's old suit had split in several places
he was getting it off by sucking it into his mouth
in a few minutes his hind legs were free of the old suit
little by little it began to be pulled free from his body
all the time old mister toad was working very hard to suck it at the corners of his big mouth
but he couldn't say anything because his mouth was too full
he looked so funny that peter just threw himself on the ground and rolled over and over with laughter
this made old mister toad glare more angrily than ever
when he had got his hands free by pulling the sleeves of his old coat off inside out
he used his hands to pull the last of it over his head
then he gulped very hard two or three times to swallow his old suit
don't you know that it is the most impolite thing in the world to look at people when they are changing their clothes
peter rabbit didn't blame old mister toad a bit for being indignant because peter had watched him change his suit
old mister toad had looked very funny while he was struggling out of his old suit
i just naturally turned it over to find out what was there
i didn't have the least idea that you were there
i couldn't help laughing because you really did look so funny
that it seems at all wonderful to you that you can change your suit that way
now i know it is so and just how you do it
i feel as if i had learned something worth knowing
i think you are one of the most interesting and wonderful of all my neighbors
but it was very clear that he was a little flattered by peter's interest in him and was rapidly recovering his good nature
that is where you go to to sleep all winter
do you go down into the mud at the bottom of the smiling pool the way grandfather frog does
if i had spent the winter in the smiling pool
do you suppose i would have left it to come way up here and then have turned right around and gone back there to sing
im not so fond of long journeys as all that
is that you speak first and do your thinking afterward
you mean that you would hide under that old board just as you did before
i could disappear and not go near that old board
but not a thing could he see under which old mister toad could possibly hide except the old board
but youll have to show me before i can believe that
here was a chance to get even with peter for watching him change his suit
if youll turn your back to me and look straight down the crooked little path for five minutes
i give you my word of honor that i will not hop three feet from where i am sitting
ill look down the crooked little path for five minutes and promise not to peek
so peter sat and gazed straight down the crooked little path
it was a great temptation to roll his eyes back and peep behind him
but there was not a sign of old mister toad
he had disappeared as completely as if he never had been there
old mister toad was getting even with peter for laughing at him
he couldn't see so much as a chip under which old mister toad might have hidden
old mister toad had given his word of honor that he wouldn't hide under that
peter hopped over to it and turned it over again
because he couldn't think of any other place to look
he had given his word that he wouldn't hide there
peter should have known better than to have looked there
old mister toad had also said that he would not go three feet from the spot where he was sitting at the time
so peter should have known better than to have raced up the crooked little path as he did
but if old mister toad had nothing to hide under
so peter ran this way and that way a great deal farther than it would have been possible for old mister toad to have gone
presently peter returned and sat down on the very spot where he had last seen old mister toad
peter never had felt more foolish in all his life
he began to think that old mister toad must be bewitched and had some strange power of making himself invisible
trying to puzzle out how old mister toad had disappeared
suddenly peter gave a frightened scream and jumped higher than he ever had jumped before in all his life
there sat old mister toad right where he himself had been sitting a moment before
he began to sink down into the ground until only the top of his head could be seen
he began to dig away the sand where old mister toad had been sitting
i think you have a little the best of it
old mister toad held up one of his stout hind feet
i make my hole in soft earth and back into it at the same time
for you see it was very loose and not packed down at all
xvi jimmy skunk is surprised jimmy skunk ambled along the crooked little path down the hill
the only time he ever hurries is when he sees a fat beetle trying to get out of sight
so he just ambled along as if he had all the time in the world
he knew that there were more if he could find them
jimmy had laughed at peter rabbit for being so anxious for summer to arrive
but he was just as glad as peter that she had come
there's a nice big piece of bark over there that looks as if it ought to have a dozen fat beetles under it
it's great fun to pull over pieces of bark and see fat beetles run all ways at once
ill just have to see what is under that piece
jimmy tiptoed softly over to the big piece of bark
instead of the fat beetles he had been so sure of
i didn't know you were under that piece of bark
only you are the second one ive met this morning who had just waked up
toads mistake if is a very little word to look at
but the biggest word you have ever seen doesn't begin to have so much meaning as little if
why old mister toad wouldn't have made the mistake he did
but jimmy skunk did amble down the crooked little path
old mister toad had crept under that piece of bark because he wanted to take a nap
but when jimmy skunk told him that he had seen mister blacksnake that very morning
the very last bit of sleepiness left old mister toad
he knew right away why mister blacksnake had asked after him
he knew that mister blacksnake has a fondness for toads
he turned quite pale when he heard that mister blacksnake had asked after him
he was in such a hurry to get away from that neighborhood that he forgot to ask jimmy skunk just where he had seen mister blacksnake
he hardly waited long enough to say goodby to jimmy skunk
now it just happened that old mister toad started up the crooked little path
it just happened that mister blacksnake was coming down the crooked little path
they almost always seem to think that danger is behind instead of in front of them
instead of watching out in front as he hopped along
he was so sure that mister blacksnake was somewhere behind him that he didn't look to see where he was going
you know that people who don't look to see where they are going are almost sure to go headfirst right into trouble
old mister toad went hopping up the crooked little path as fast as he could
all the time he kept looking behind for mister blacksnake
presently he came to a turn in the crooked little path
for just a wee second they stared at each other
started down the crooked little path twice as fast as he had come up
not very fast because he knew that he wouldn't have to run very fast to catch old mister toad
this is how it happened that summer morning that jolly
blue sky and smiling to see how happy everybody seemed
suddenly discovered that there was one of the little meadow people who wasn't happy
it was old mister toad hopping down the crooked little path for his life
xviii jimmy skunk is just in time jimmy skunk ambled slowly along
chuckling as he thought of what a hurry mister toad had been in
when he had heard that mister blacksnake had asked after him
he had just happened to think that old mister toad had gone up the crooked little path
it was up the crooked little path that mister blacksnake had shown himself that morning
old mister toad is hopping right straight into the very worst kind of trouble
how stupid of him not to have asked me where mister blacksnake was
but he had gone on down the crooked little path only a few steps when he stopped again
somehow he didn't like to think of what might happen to old mister toad
the green meadows wouldn't be quite the same without old mister toad
for if i hadn't pulled over that piece of bark
he probably would have stayed there the rest of the day and been safe
he had just reached a turn in the crooked little path when who should run right plump into him but poor old mister toad
he gave a frightened squeal and fell right over on his back
kicked foolishly as he tried to get on his feet again
so frightened and tired that all he could do was to kick and kick
he didn't even know who it was he had run into
jimmy skunk just laughed and stepped in front of poor old mister toad
mister blacksnake coiled himself up in the path and darted his tongue out at jimmy in the most impudent way
then he jumped straight at jimmy skunk with his mouth wide open
but he took great care not to jump quite far enough to reach jimmy
he knows all about mister blacksnake and that really he is a coward
so he suddenly gritted his teeth in a way not at all pleasant to hear and started for mister blacksnake
he suddenly turned and glided back up the crooked little path
now you get your breath and come along with me
toad gets his stomach full pray do not tip your nose in scorn at things which others eat
for things to you not good at all to others are most sweet
you wouldn't want to eat them even if you were dreadfully hungry
but old mister toad and buster bear think there is nothing much nicer
now buster bear had found old mister toad catching ants
it had pleased buster to find some one else who liked ants
right away he invited old mister toad to dine with him
but poor old mister toad was frightened almost to death when he heard the deep
for he had been so busy watching the ants that he hadn't seen buster coming
you see he didn't have the least doubt in the world that buster bear meant to eat him
he was sure that that was just a joke on buster's part
after a little old mister toad thought it best to be polite
so he said in a very faint voice that he would be pleased to dine with buster
but when buster reached out a great paw with great cruellooking claws mister toad quite gave up
he just closed his eyes and waited for the end
he was rolled over on to his feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise
it didn't seem possible that such a great paw could be so gentle
said buster bear in a voice which he tried to make sound pleasant
i know where there is a fine dinner waiting for us just a little way from here
he hooked his great claws into the old log and gave a mighty pull
more ants than mister toad had seen in all his life before
for a little while he was the busiest toad ever seen
then he remembered buster bear and looked up a little fearfully
somehow this time old mister toad didn't mind because his voice sounded grumblyrumbly
toad is puffed up old mister toad hopped slowly down the lone little path
he was so puffed up that he couldn't have hopped fast if he had wanted to
in the first place his stomach was so full of ants that there wasn't room for another one
old mister toad couldn't have swallowed another ant if he had tried
but it wasn't the ants that puffed him out all over
you know nothing can puff any one up quite like foolish pride
old mister toad was old enough to have known better
it is bad enough to see young and foolish creatures puffed up with pride
but it is worse to see any one as old as old mister toad that way
he held his head so high that he couldn't see his own feet
it wouldn't do to pretend not to hear this time
danny grinned as he watched him hop on down the lone little path
ive heard that pride is very apt to turn people's heads
but i never expected to see old mister toad proud
but old mister toad took no notice of him at all
peter might have been a stick or a stone for all the notice old mister toad took of him
then he hurried down to tell danny meadow mouse about it
he was very much put out because he had been treated by old mister toad just as peter rabbit had
it was the same with all of old mister toad's old friends and neighbors
to him old mister toad was very polite and talked a great deal about buster bear
thought that bobby must be very proud to be related to buster
at first everybody thought it a great joke to see old mister toad so puffed up with
but after a little they grew tired of being snubbed by their old friend and neighbor
then they decided that what old mister toad needed was a lesson
so they put their heads together and planned how they would teach old mister toad how foolish it is for any one to be puffed up with pride
toad receives another invitation the friends and neighbors of old mister toad decided that he needed to be taught a lesson
because he had grown too proud to speak to them
but after a little they grew tired of being treated so
some of them put their heads together to think of some plan to teach old mister toad a lesson and what a very
the very next day jimmy skunk went into the green forest to look for buster bear
the very first thing he did was to ask buster if he had seen any fat beetles that morning
the first thing he asks any one he may happen to meet is if they have seen any
buster bear grinned and said he thought he knew where there might be a few
he would be pleased to have jimmy go with him to see
these jimmy gobbled up without even asking buster if he would have one
i am afraid he is rather apt to when fat beetles are concerned
when the last beetle had disappeared jimmy smacked his lips
then he told buster bear what he had come for
at first buster had thought it was for the fat beetles
it was to get buster bear's help in a plan to teach old mister toad a lesson
first jimmy told buster all about how puffed up old mister toad was because he had dined with buster
how ever since then he had refused even to speak to his old friends and neighbors
it tickled buster bear so to think that little homely old mister toad could be proud of anything that he laughed and laughed
then jimmy told him the plan to teach old mister toad a lesson and asked buster if he would help
buster's eyes twinkled as he promised to do what jimmy asked
then jimmy went straight to where old mister toad was sitting all puffed up
just think how he swelled out when he heard that
that i shall be very happy to honor him by dining with him
old mister toad sat and puffed himself out until he could hardly breathe
toad learns a lesson pride is like a great big bubble youll find there's nothing in it
prick it and for all your trouble it has vanished in a minute
this made old mister toad feel more important and proud than ever
he might not have felt quite so puffed up if he had known just how it had come about that he received this second invitation to dine with buster bear
jimmy didn't tell him that buster had been asked to send the invitation
that it was all part of a plan on the part of some of old mister toad's old friends and neighbors to teach him a lesson
so old mister toad went hopping along and stumbling over his own feet
because his head was held so high and he was so puffed out that he couldn't see where he was going
he could think of nothing but how important buster bear must consider him to invite him to dinner a second time
of the delicious ants he was sure he would have to eat
how very fortunate it is that he found out that i also am fond of ants
he was so busy with these pleasant thoughts and of the good dinner that he expected to have that he took no notice of what was going on about him
he didn't see his old friends and neighbors peeping out at him and laughing because he looked so foolish and silly
for you know old mister toad has no fine clothes
although he couldn't help panting for breath as he said it
i hope you are feeling as well as you are looking
i always feel fine when there is a dinner of fat ants ready for me
it is fine of you to honor me by coming to dine
here mister toad put one hand on his stomach and tried to make a very grand bow
i have ventured to invite another to enjoy the dinner with us
he wanted to be the only one to have the honor of dining with buster bear
old mister toad looked in the direction in which buster bear was looking
he turned his back on buster bear and started back the way he had come
then old mister toad knew that his old friends and neighbors had planned this to teach him a lesson
toad is very humble when old mister toad saw mister blacksnake and turned his back on buster bear and the fine dinner to which buster had invited him
that was to get out of sight of mister blacksnake as soon as possible
he forgot all the pride with which he had been so puffed up
he forgot everything but the need of getting out of sight of mister blacksnake as soon as ever he could
he heard peter rabbit and jimmy skunk and johnny chuck and others of his old friends and neighbors shouting with laughter
he hadn't room for any feeling except fear of mister blacksnake
but old mister toad had to stop after a while
his legs were so tired they just wouldn't go any longer
there he lay flat on the ground and panted and panted for breath
bright mister sun went to bed behind the purple hills
for it was dark under that big piece of bark
then he began to see how foolish and silly he had been
the only thing that i have to be proud of is that im honest and work for my living
but peter suddenly threw his head up very high and strutted past as if he didn't see old mister toad at all
jimmy went right on about his business and actually stepped right over old mister toad as if he had been a stick or a stone
the next day he went down to see danny meadow mouse
he meant to tell danny how ashamed he was for the way he had treated danny and his other friends
but danny brushed right past without even a glance at him
old mister toad gulped and started up to see johnny chuck
at last old mister toad gave up and went home
where he sat under a big mullein leaf the rest of the day
he didn't have appetite enough to snap at a single fly
late that afternoon he heard a little noise and looked up to find all his old friends and neighbors forming a circle around him
suddenly they began to dance and shout old mister toad is a jolly good fellow
now that his bubble of pride is quite busted we know that he knows that his friends can be trusted
then old mister toad knew that all was well once more
this is all for now about homely old mister toad
because i have just got to tell you about another homely fellow
the next book will tell you all about his adventures
